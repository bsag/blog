<p>What with all the kerfuffle of <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/2006/08/07/emerging-from-the-boxes/">moving</a> and so on, I missed most of the buzz around Apple's announcement of some of the features to be introduced in <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/">Leopard</a>: the next version of MacOS X. I've had a little time to read the information now, and some of the features look pretty spiffy. <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/timemachine.html">Time Machine</a> in particular looks interesting. The idea is that the system keeps an automatic, incremental backup of your entire system. If you want to retrieve something from an earlier system state (perhaps because you've mistakenly deleted a file), you can use the Time Machine interface to 'go back in time' and retrieve your deleted file.</p>

<p>It's fair to say that Apple has received a bit of gentle (and not so gentle) ribbing about the interface. The perspective display of windows receding into the distance is very cool, but they chose to show an image of a star field behind the windows. I quite like it, but it is a tad <em>literal</em>. Still, it could be worse. They could have gone 80's Sci-Fi-tastic and had some kind of swirly vortex together with calendar pages fluttering away into the void.</p>

<p>I'm interested in the technology behind this feature. Constant incremental backups could obviously consume even the biggest of hard drives in no time, so there must (we hope) be some kind of clever compression involved, or perhaps the system just stores the changes in files rather than the whole file after a complete initial backup has been made (something like Subversion). There has been a lot of speculation suggesting that Time Machine might be based on <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/zfs/whatis/">ZFS</a>---the file system all the geeks are raving about. However, it seems that's <a href="http://storagemojo.com/?p=213">not the case</a>, and it's probably just plain old journalled HFS+, which is a bit of a shame. Anyway, it will be interesting to see how it performs.</p>

<p>I'm also pleased to see that Apple has <em>finally</em> adopted virtual desktops (available in just about every Linux implementation) in the form of <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/spaces.html">Spaces</a>. I've used a number of virtual desktop applications on MacOS X, but currently use <a href="http://codetek.com/ctvd/">Codetek's VirtualDesktop Pro</a>. I must say that Apple's implementation looks very slick, but if you can't have more than four desktops (it's not clear from the information available), I'll probably stick with my 8 desktops on VirtualDesktop Pro. I've got so used to the layout of my desktops that it's practically muscle memory now.</p>

<p>Some of the other features don't excite me quite as much, but I think it will still be a pretty good OS upgrade, particularly the tantalising 'secret features' that Apple is keeping under wraps until later.</p>
