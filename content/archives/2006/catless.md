<p>My parents came up this weekend to pick up our feline <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/2006/03/19/house-guest/">house guest</a>, and the house suddenly seems empty and a bit lifeless without that little furry monster. I miss her jumping in my lap and head-butting my book as a not-so-subtle cue that I should be getting her dinner ready, I miss the way she wound herself around my legs, purring furiously when I was trying to get my jeans on in the morning, and I miss her suddenly curling herself into the tightest possible ball, paw over her eyes on the sofa in the evening.</p>

<p>On the plus side, our battered, scarred and heavily repaired <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bsag/126480503/">fridge magnets</a> are probably now safe.</p>
