<p>A week or so ago, I had a email via flickr from <a href="http://www.schmap.com/">Schmap Guides</a> to tell me that my shortlisted photograph (of the inside of the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford) had been selected for the Oxford Guide. Yay! The Schmap Guides are apparently free, downloadable guides with maps, photographs, reviews and so on for places in the UK and beyond. I say 'apparently' because at the moment the viewer is Windows only, so I can't take a look. Anyway, if you have a Windows PC you can download the <a href="http://www.schmap.com/guides/unitedkingdom">Oxford guide here</a> if you're interested. If you do, can you send me a screenshot of the page with <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/bsag/150497605/">my photograph</a> on?</p>
