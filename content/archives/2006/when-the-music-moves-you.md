<p>I've got used to putting up with the awful techno dreck that seems to get played in most gyms, so I thought I might be dreaming when I heard Pink Floyd as I started my workout this morning. I rowed to 'Comfortably Numb', which seemed utterly appropriate in the circumstances. Obviously someone with taste had broken in to the music system. I had the best workout I'd had for ages, lifting heavier weights and doing better in my aerobic workout. Coincidence? I think not.</p>
