<p>When I was a kid, I used to go swimming every week at our local swimming baths (as we called it then, rather than 'swimming pool'). It was a lovely Victorian building<sup id="r1-100106"><a href="#f1-100106">1</a></sup>, with the original tiles, a cast iron turnstile that could stop a charging rhino (handy for all those occasions on which a rhino is desperate to get in for a swim without paying), but rather short on modern conveniences like footbaths or a metric length. I loved swimming. I wasn't fast or particularly stylish, but I could plod up and down for hours very happily. In fact, I spent most of the time swimming underwater, loving the feeling of exploring another world.</p>

<p>I've got quite long eyelashes, and the water on my lashes generated rainbows from the lights whenever I blinked. And I must be the only person in the world who actually likes the smell and taste of chlorine. This is a slightly shameful confession, but after I'd been swimming, I used to secretly lick my own arm, because I liked the faint residual taste of chlorine. I don't do that now, of course...</p>

<p>I have <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/2005/06/23/a-new-regime/">started going swimming</a> recently at the University, though, and I love my dawn swims before work, watching the rainbows burst from the lights.</p>
