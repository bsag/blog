<p>I'm in the middle of a huge grant application right now, as well as trying to organise the (hopefully!) final stages of our house move which seems to have gone at a tectonic pace. So I'm much busier than I'd like to be, and longing for a time---about a month and half from now, with any luck---when it might be all over and I can relax. A bit.</p>

<p>So this post is intended as a big, fat apology for the lack of any interesting content in these parts right now. Normal service will (eventually) be resumed.</p>
