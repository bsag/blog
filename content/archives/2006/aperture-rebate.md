<p>If you're an Apple fan, you might remember that a few months ago, Apple dropped the price of their <a href="http://www.apple.com/aperture/">Aperture</a> photographic workflow software drastically after releasing the much-improved version 1.1. Now, this would have been a bit galling for those who had bought the original version at the much higher price (as I did), but Apple---rather splendidly, in my view---offered a rebate for the price difference (more or less) to registered users of Aperture 1.0.</p>

<p>So I filled in the rebate form as soon as it was posted and waited for the voucher to come in. I received it this week, so I now have a handsome Â£130 e-voucher to <del>blow</del> spend wisely on Apple's online store. I'm like a kid in a sweet shop...</p>
