<p><p class="img-shadow"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bsag/86428009/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/38/86428009_30f4df5800_m.jpg" width="240" height="151" alt="Wha?" /></a></p> I was coming home on the train last night, too tired to even read, and was just staring into space when I noticed this strange sign just below the bus connections map on the wall of the carriage.</p>

<p>I just had to get up and take a picture (trying not to look too conspicuous). It's obviously a joke, but I'm wondering if it's one of the spoof signs put up by Dave Askwith and Alex Normanton, and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/4470516.stm">featured</a> on the BBC's website. Wherever it came from, it really cheered me up!</p>
