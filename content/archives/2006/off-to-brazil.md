<p>I'm off to Brazil to work for three weeks tomorrow. What with my slightly dodgy health situation, and leaving our new house just when I'm settling in, I can't say that I'm as excited as I might be about going. It's also a long time to be away from Mr. Bsag. At least this year, we got to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary together (it's today).</p>

<p>Still, I've got several tonnes of equipment crammed in a suitcase with some clothes filling the gaps, checked my hand baggage repeatedly for any deadly liquids, gels or creams (aaarghh! lip salve!), and I have a big roll of gaffer tape to fix anything that needs fixing, and to effect emergency surgical repairs. Gaffer tape can hold anything together, right?</p>

<p>See you all when I get back, and have a great September.</p>
