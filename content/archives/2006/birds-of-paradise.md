<p>I sometimes amuse myself in idle moments by trying to compile a list of my 'Desert Island Animals' -- those animals I would most like to watch (not eat!) if stranded on a desert island devoid of other life. It's always very hard to choose, but collectively, Birds of Paradise often rank highly (choosing <em>among</em> the Birds of Paradise, however, is nearly impossible). So I was delighted to see some excellent footage of several species on the 'Jungles' episode of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/animals/planetearth/flashapp/">Planet Earth</a>.</p>

<p>It isn't just that they are brightly coloured: many birds are. Birds of Paradise<sup id="r1-241106"><a href="#f1-241106">1</a></sup> have so many pop-up crests, chest shields, cloaks and deely-bopper-like head appendages that they can change the outline of their body completely. They are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers_series">Transformers</a> of the bird world. As if that wasn't enough, they often accompany this visual transformation with an eccentric dance and an unearthly sound.</p>

<p>The Superb Bird of Paradise (<em>Lophorina superba</em>) is a great example of this principle. At rest, it looks like a pretty black bird with a striking metallic turquoise chest, but when it displays, which you can see in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/check/nature/animals/planetearth/realmedia/video/pe0106?size=16x9&amp;bgc=C0C0C0&amp;nbram=1&amp;bbram=1">this clip</a>, it erects a set of feathers to turn its whole front elevation into a vertical elliptical shield, with a huge turquoise segment. Just in case that doesn't get the female's full attention, he throws in a clicking sound like someone trying unsuccessfully to light a gas stove, and bounces up and down in a sexy fashion. If you haven't seen it before, you'll be staring and yelling "<em>Whaaat!</em>". Even if you have seen it before, you'll be wondering (in the original sense of the word) how the heck you turn something bird-shaped into something that looks like the Superb Bird of Paradise when displaying. Birds of Paradise: Birds in Disguise.</p>

<p><sup id="f1-241106">1</sup> That is, males do. The females are brownish and ordinary-looking. However, they are the architects of the males' amazing displays through their choice of mates, so they are impressive in another way. <a href="#r1-241106">&uarr;</a></p>
