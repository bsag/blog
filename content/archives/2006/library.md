<p>In the centre of Birmingham, I overheard this exchange between a mother and her 5 or six year old daughter:</p>

<blockquote>
Mum: ...and then we'll go to the Library.
Daughter (bouncing up and down with excitement): Yay! I <strong>love</strong> going to the library! Yippee!
</blockquote>

<p>Talk about the perfect kid.</p>

<p>On the subject of libraries, we now have a library literally four doors down from our house. It's pretty tiny, and has somewhat eccentric opening hours, but... a library! Practically on our doorstep! Better still, you can reserve any book in the entire Birmingham library system online, and have it delivered to your local library.</p>

<p>Mmmm. Books.</p>
