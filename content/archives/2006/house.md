<p>I have to admit it: I'm addicted to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412142/">House</a>. I'm a bit of a latecomer to the show, and initially thought that I'd hate it because I couldn't see Hugh Laurie (who I visualise as Bertie Wooster because of his role in the classic <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098833/">Jeeves and Wooster</a> TV series) as a grizzled, misanthropic and---above all---American doctor. But he pulls it off wonderfully. In many ways, Gregory House is a kind of anti-Wooster, and if their characters were ever to meet, I suspect that it might bring about the destruction of the Universe.</p>

<p>I'm keen on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108757/">ER</a>, but often there's frustratingly little of the exciting diagnosis of mysterious diseases part, and a lot of dull 'relationship' stuff. However, in ER I can (at least some of the time) correctly diagnose the patient's problem before the doctors do, which is something I can <em>never</em> do with House. I've tried guessing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_erythematosus">Lupus erythematosus</a> a few times, purely on the basis that it's obscure, has lots of interesting symptoms and cool name, but with no success so far.</p>

<p>I love the whole House/Holmes, Wilson/Watson thing, and House is paradoxically a very appealing character. He's so even-handedly horrible to everyone, regardless of age, race, religion or gender, that he somehow manages to be perversely charming. Mind you, if he was <em>my</em> doctor, I'd make sure I was never ill.</p>
