<p>There was an excellent quote on <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/2006/01/12/hyperdrive/">Hyperdrive</a> last night, which might well become my favoured expression of mindless enthusiasm: "Set lasers to patriotic". I like it despite the fact that I'm not in the least patriotic.</p>
