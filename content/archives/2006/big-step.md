<p>Today had our under-the-asking-price offer accepted on a house we really want to buy, which was simultaneously exciting and terrifying. I don't want to get too excited at this stage because there are about a gazillion things that could go wrong with the sale (though there's no chain at all, which does simplify things a bit). But somehow I can't help getting excited. <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/2006/04/05/mac-nostalgia/">Eep</a>!</p>
