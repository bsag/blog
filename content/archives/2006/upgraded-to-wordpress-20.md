<p>I've just upgraded to WordPress 2.0 (always a somewhat nerve-wracking process). Things generally seem OK, with the exception that the commenting form has gone AWOL. Previous comments are being displayed, but there's no form to add new ones.</p>

<p>So, yes---I do know about it, and I'm currently trying to fix it. More later.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> OK, I think that's go it. It was a rogue plugin. Let me know if there are any other screwy things.</p>
