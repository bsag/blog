<p>OK---that's it. I'm officially fed up of the hot weather. It would be fine if I could just laze around with a cool drink in my hand, but working, commuting and clearing out dusty shelves and cupboards is decidedly not fun in these kinds of temperatures.</p>

<p>All this week, my commute has been disrupted by bending or broken rails. Leaving aside the question of why Network Rail seems to use a metal with a melting point of 30 deg Celsius (perhaps Cadbury makes the rails for them at Bournville?), cramming a lot of hot, sticky and---above all---<em>late</em> commuters on to trains and platforms does not make for happy customers.</p>

<p>On Thursday, I abandoned the train at New Street Station because it was clear I wasn't going to get much further very quickly, and tried to head out of the station to catch a bus. I left the platform by the escalators, and there were so many people on the concourse at the top, that there was a cartoon pile-up. People stepping off the escalator had nowhere to go but to crash into the backs of those in front of them. Ah, what fun!</p>
