<p>It was too hot to sleep last night. It's funny how the weather mimics your mood sometimes. We're supposed to be completing on our new house purchase tomorrow, and then moving, so we're in limbo, just waiting.</p>

<p>At about midnight, we temporarily gave up on sleep and sat on the patio in our pyjamas, enjoying the cooler air outside and watching the lightning from a distant storm flash on the horizon. We could hear the voices of our neighbours, also too hot to sleep. Everyone was waiting for the storm, the cool rain and that gorgeous sharp smell of storm rain on dry ground. But the rain never came, and we're still feeling that oppressive pressure of waiting. I'll be glad when the next week is over.</p>
