<p><a href="http://words.danhon.com/">Dan Hon</a> has a cracking piece on <a href="http://words.danhon.com/?p=5">children's names inspired by fonts</a> on his new blog.  Some of them made me laugh out loud:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Copperplate (boy's name, ginger hair)</li>
<li>Comic Sans MS (only if you're an eccentric celebrity)</li>
<li>Monaco (probably already being used by Victoria Beckham or Madonna)</li>
<li>Rockwell (cowboy)</li>
<li>Schoolhouse Cursive B (exception that quite irritatingly does something to the rule)</li>
<li>SimSun (possibly something that would inadvertently either please or dishonour my parents)</li>
<li>Snell Roundhand (old money again)</li>
<li>Trebuchet (military family)</li>
<li>Wide Latin (mean mother making a comment about how her daughter should lose some weight)</li>
<li>Tahoma (surname probably Phoenix)</li>
<li>Mistral (girl's name)</li>
<li>Marker Felt (never going to work as a teacher)</li>
<li>Lucida Sans (quite posh girl)</li>
<li>Wingdings (see earlier comment about my parents, or possibly suitable for a chicken farmer's son)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>It had me searching through the Fonts palette to find a few more. Plantagenet Cherokee (rugged yet sensitive) seems like quite a good name for the hero of a novel, and in honour of the rather dubious name for the new Intel Apple laptops, how about LiHei Pro?</p>
