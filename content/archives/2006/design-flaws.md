<p>There are few things more irritating than everyday objects that are badly designed. In our building at work, we have stainless steel sinks in the toilets, which are circular in outline, and more or less hemispherical in shape. They look lovely but are hugely irritating to use. You know what happens when you turn on the tap in your kitchen sink without realising that there's a upturned teaspoon in the bottom of the sink? Well, imagine that effect but with a teaspoon the size of the entire sink. Water striking the sink with moderate force bounces straight off and conveniently soaks your groin area, rather than dampening your hands, which would have been much more useful.</p>

<p>The whole thing is made much worse by the taps, which are the 'push to operate' kind. It's true that they save water because people can't accidentally leave them running. However, these appear to have only a binary mode of operation, and are either off, or gush water at full force---no intermediate flow rates seem to be possible. So you can only wash one hand at a time, while using the other to push the tap down, but somehow most other areas of your body get a thorough soaking.</p>

<p>I hate those sinks.</p>
