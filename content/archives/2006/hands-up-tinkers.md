<p><a href="http://www.douglasjohnston.net/weblog">Douglas Johnston</a> has been <a href="http://www.douglasjohnston.net/weblog/archives/2006/01/04/tinkertailor/">developing a taxonomy</a> of different archetypes of people who are constantly playing with their productivity systems: Tinkers, Tailors, Soldiers and Spies. It was immediately obvious to me which I was--like Douglas, I am a Tinker. To quote him:</p>

<ul>
<li>"The Tinker is the consumate tweaker for tweaking's sake." Oh, that's me all right.</li>
<li>"...modify existing setups (even if they already work fine)". Check.</li>
<li>"Tinkers are far less concerned about using the system than the idea of creating it...". Check.</li>
<li>"Fascinated by planners, bags and utensils with multiple uses, hidden compartments...". Oh my, <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/2005/11/24/one-bag-to-rule-them-all/">yes</a>.</li>
<li>"...the Tinker might also carry a Swiss Army Knife, Leatherman..." Check! </li>
</ul>

<p>Hey, has he been going through the hidden compartments in my multi-purpose bag?</p>
