<p>Since we got our <a href="http://elgato.com/">EyeTV</a> unit, we've accumulated quite a collection of recordings that we'd like to burn to DVD. Some fit neatly on a disc, but others are just a tiny bit too long to fit on a single disc, and with a film it's annoying to have to cut it in half and split it over two.</p>

<p>I wanted to make a disc for my Dad for Father's Day, but I couldn't fit the 15 episodes of a particular show on one disc (I can't say which show in case he happens to read this before next Sunday), and I only had one blank DVD left. What to do...</p>

<p>Fortuitously, I came across <a href="http://www.techspansion.com/visualhub/">VisualHub</a>, which not only converts a huge range of video formats into a number of other formats (for iPod, TV, DVD, PSP etc.), but also claimed to be able to compress video so that 18 hours could be fitted on a single-sided DVD. So I tried it and found that it works really well. The automatic compression required to fit more than 5 hours of footage on to a DVD resulted in no noticeable decrease in quality, and it was really easy to use. I can see that I'm going to get a lot of use out of that.</p>
