<p>We sometimes listen to 'Private Passions' a programme on Radio 3 in which generally erudite people talk to Michael Berkeley about their favourite pieces of music. It's a bit like an upmarket version of Desert Island Discs, but without the restrictions on numbers of pieces, and they actually play the whole piece rather than snippets.</p>

<p>So when Mr. Bsag was looking at the Radio Times yesterday and said, "Anna Nicole Smith is on Private Passions tomorrow", I did a bit of a mental double-take.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Me:</strong> Anna Nicole Smith? She of the surgical enhancement and the ancient, super-rich late husband?

<strong>Mr. B. (rolling eyes and enunciating clearly):</strong> No. <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/features/mccallsmith/">Alexander McCall Smith</a>.</blockquote>

<p>Ah, OK. The world makes sense again.</p>
