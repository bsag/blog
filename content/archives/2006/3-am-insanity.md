<p>I blame it on being very busy at both work and home recently, but lately I've been waking at 2 or 3 am most mornings, having just come out of a dream about getting an angry email from a colleague or from a reader of this blog, lambasting me for something or other. In a sleepy, confused state, I know very well that it was just a dream, but for some reason I can't shake off the feeling that should go and check my email on the computer, as if I've got an IMAP connection on a secret dream port, and might have actually divined the content of a genuine email in my sleep. Ridiculous. But I lie awake for half an hour or so, telling myself that I'm being a complete muppet, and trying to resist the urge to lift the lid of my PowerBook.</p>

<p>Of course, in the morning, it's instantly obvious to me that it was all ludicrous, and I was worrying about nothing. I think that it's a good indication that I should never try to make an important decision at about 3 am, because my ability to distinguish reality from fiction is obviously seriously impaired at that hour. It's lucky that I don't have to do night shifts.</p>
