<p>This is all over the place at the moment, but this newly discovered <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060308/ap_on_sc/france_new_crustacean">hairy crustacean</a> is so cute that I had to link to it. Even its name is adorable: <em>Kiwa hirsuta</em>. Appropriate too.</p>

<p>But am I the only one who thinks that it looks like a distant albino cousin of the <a href="http://www.agreatbighuginamug.com/">Hug-in-a-Mug</a> blue Hug Monster?</p>
