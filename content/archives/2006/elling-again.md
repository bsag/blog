<p>Yesterday we saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0279064/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9ZWxsaW5nfGZ0PTF8bXg9MjB8bG09NTAwfGNvPTF8aHRtbD0xfG5tPTE_;fc=1;ft=22;fm=1">Elling</a> again, courtesy of a special edition, exclusive to <a href="http://www.lovefilm.com">Lovefilm</a> (of which more later). It was just as good as the <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/2003/04/20/elling/">last time we saw it</a>, and I get the feeling that it's one of those films like 'The Big Liebowski' and 'It's a Wonderful Life' that I could happily watch many times, particularly when I'm feeling a bit cheesed off with life.</p>

<p>What I can't understand is why this film---which had a cinematic release in 2001, and which has won a clutch of awards---hasn't been released as a subtitled version in the rest of Europe yet. At amazon.co.uk, you can <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006L92B/butshesagirl-21/">buy a US version</a>, but it's both a Region 1 disc (which isn't too much of a problem for most people in the UK) and in NTSC format (which is).</p>

<p>I notice with a slightly sinking heart that a new version is being made in the US. Yet again, it seems, Hollywood has decided to try to remake a masterpiece unnecessarily, just to get English speaking actors in the roles. But the original actors were brilliant, and I thought that hearing the original Norwegian added enormously to the appeal. Part of the charm is hearing the way that the actors stress words and pronounce things, even if you don't understand a word of Norwegian. If anyone knows where I can buy an English subtitled PAL format DVD of this film, do let me know.</p>
