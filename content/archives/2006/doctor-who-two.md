<p>I've tried, I really have. I've given him a good chance to prove himself, but I just can't warm to David Tennant as <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/">Doctor Who</a>. For me, he just doesn't have the charisma of Eccleston. He either seems to be wildly mugging or staring googly-eyed. There's none of the suppressed sadness or danger of Eccleston's Doctor, and despite the gratuitous snogging, I also don't see the chemistry between Rose and the Doctor that was so striking in the previous series.</p>

<p>I don't know if it's just because I don't like Tennant as the Doctor, but I don't even think that the writing is as good this series. I've found myself bored in some episodes, which isn't something I ever felt in the previous one. Oh well, I suppose I'll have to go back to my recordings of 'the golden series'. Thirteen episodes of perfection is pretty good, after all (as Firefly proved, though that was 16).</p>
