<p>In the latest of a series of on-going plumbing problems, our shower has broken, so we're having to take baths instead. Bathing rather than showering is annoying because it takes so much longer and wastes a lot of water, but it is really quite excellent when you're very tired from your first day back at work after six weeks of sick leave, and even better when <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/clue/">I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue</a> is on the radio at the same time.</p>

<p>We have a shower (i.e. splash-proof) radio, but it's difficult to hear when the water's running. So it's a real pleasure to lie back in lovely warm water, while it's chucking it down with rain outside and blowing a gale outside, and relish the surreal experience of the words of <a href="http://hjem.get2net.dk/sbn/misc/ladies/uptown.txt">Uptown Top Ranking</a> to the tune of 'When You Wish Upon A Star'.</p>
