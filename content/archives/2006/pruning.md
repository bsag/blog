<p>One of the previous owners of our house planted a bamboo plant next to a little bubble fountain. It's attractive, and gives the garden a slightly Japanese feel, but they neglected to plant the bamboo in a pot sunk into the ground. Consequently, the plant has drawn up complex invasion plans (complete with little model bamboo plants placed on a huge map, which are pushed about by uniformed young women with long sticks), and is gradually strangling any other plants rash enough to be sitting immobile in its rampaging path.</p>

<p>So, at the weekend, I decided that it was time to launch the counter attack, and reclaim some territory. I didn't want to just destroy it, because it does form quite a nice, rounded clump, but I wasn't at all confident in my ability to cut it back evenly. I was half expecting to end up in a kind of <a href="http://www.gladding.com/rsf/">Right Said Fred</a> situation, cutting back more and more to try and even it up, until the bamboo was a couple of sad-looking bare twigs. However, I must have more topiary skills than I gave myself credit for, because it ended up as a smaller version of the rounded clump I started with. Despite the fact that it was hard work (particularly the bit when I had to climb into the shrubbery to lop off the shoots that were coming up in an adjacent bed), I found pruning quite therapeutic. There's something about brutally attacking greenery with sharp shears that makes you forget your worries for a while.</p>
