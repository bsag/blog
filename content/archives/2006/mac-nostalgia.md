<p><a href="http://go-blog-go.blogspot.com/">Saltation</a> sent me a link to this <a href="http://myoldmac.net/webse-e-flash.htm">classic site</a>, a brilliantly done emulation of a Mac SE running System 7.1. Words cannot express how wonderful it is---just go and visit it. It even has the Russian Tetris on it, on which I wasted many an hour while trying to write my PhD thesis on my PowerBook 100 running System 7. The 'eep' sound while the system extensions were loading almost brought nostalgic tears to my eyes.</p>
