<p>I'm finding it so hard to concentrate at the moment. The problem seems to seep into every part of my life, but it's particularly acute at work. I did at least manage to finish preparing a talk for a conference this afternoon, but only by forcing myself to concentrate every five minutes by setting a timer to beep annoyingly at me. It's partly because we're caught up in the whole 'Oh no, where are we <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/2006/02/28/moving-house/">going to live</a>' thing. We went to see a couple of houses last night, and I was awake until about 2am mentally arranging furniture, comparing commuting distances, generally weighing up pros and cons. It's not even as if we're mad keen on that particular house---we just have way too many unknown variables at the moment. To make matters worse, the variables that we do know about (for example, how much money we have to spend) don't allow us to solve the equation. Stupid maths.</p>
