<p>In homage to Douglas Adams' and John Lloyd's excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0330322206/qid=1139956471/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/202-0145059-1053435">The Deeper Meaning of Liff</a>:</p>

<p><strong>dorking</strong> (<em>verb trans.</em>): the practice of expressing the curious and contradictory mixture of irritation, secret pride and frustration felt by a geek when a Google search for some vital piece of information leads to his/her own blog post on a superficially related topic. Tends to provoke thoughts similar to "if I already knew the answer, I wouldn't be Googling for it, now would I?"</p>
