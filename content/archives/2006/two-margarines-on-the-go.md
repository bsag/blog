<p>I'm ill and busy at the moment---not a great combination. To anyone else in my position can I prescribe the perfect medication? Take one listening of <a href="http://www.shuttleworths.co.uk/noise/twomarg.mp3">Two Margarines</a> by <a href="http://www.shuttleworths.co.uk/">John Shuttleworth</a> every 24 hours. It's a dramatic reconstruction of the domestic disaster of having Two Margarines on the Go (i.e. opening a new tub without realising that there is one tub already open), and set to a samba rhythm.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Two margarines on the go
It's a
Nightmare scenario
Two margarines in my fridge
It's enough to end a
Happy marriage
</p>

<p>Side effects may include Lemsip shooting from your nose.</p>
