<p>For about a week now, I've had a dodgy right foot for some unknown reason. My ankle is swollen and the ball of my heel is very sore when pressure is applied, which obviously happens very time I take a step.</p>

<p>Now that the sun has come out, I've moved to wearing my very well worn-in sandals (with no socks, naturally). Perhaps it's because my gait has changed a bit because of my right foot, but I seem to have worn a huge patch of skin off the balls of both feet. The two mile walk home was pretty painful. Stupid feet---I need an upgrade.</p>
