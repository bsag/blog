<p>I got the same, un-nameable feeling that I used to get when I was at primary school, and watched seagulls soaring around in the crisp blue sky over the playground. It was something like homesickness, and made me long to be somewhere else. This shouldn't be taken as evidence that I'm chronically unhappy at work---I'm fine. It's just that it seems to have been a long, dark winter, and it's the Friday after a <em>very</em> busy week, and I've had that, "For goodness sake, isn't it the weekend yet?" feeling for a couple of days.</p>
