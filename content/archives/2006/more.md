<p>More.</p>

<p>I'm beginning to think that 'more' might be the most insidious word in the English language.</p>

<p>More beautiful. 50% more! Do more. Earn more. Buy more. Be more. More than ever before! More minutes, more texts. More speed. More channels. More bandwidth. More downloads. More time. More money. Get more. Get more. Get more.</p>

<p>What's wrong with 'enough'? Why do we have to be accelerating, accumulating? Why can't we stand still, or even stop? Why can't we enjoy and savour, rather than consume?</p>
