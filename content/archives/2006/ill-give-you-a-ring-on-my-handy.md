<p><a href="http://www.autoblography.co.uk/backblog/2006/01/a_touch_sensitive.php">This</a> made me laugh like a drain this morning. You really have to wonder if the makers of Trivial Pursuit do any actual research at all. However, given the question about feverfew, it's entirely possible that they think we're still living in the 18th Century, and that 'handy' actually refers to semaphore without the flags.</p>
