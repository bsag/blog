<p>Our landlord wants to sell the house we're renting, so it looks like we're going to be moving again before long. It's not totally unexpected, but my heart still sinks at the prospect of going through the whole house-hunting thing again.</p>

<p>This time, we're tentatively looking in to the prospect of buying a house, mostly because we desperately want to put down some semi-permanent roots. Initial enquiries about mortgages have not been encouraging. I've promised myself that I'm not going to become a crashing 'house prices' bore, so I'll restrict myself to saying this: I find it a bit concerning that someone earning well over the national average salary can't get anywhere close to getting a mortgage for a house selling at the national average house price. Is it just me, or does that not add up?</p>
