<p>As I cycled home from work through the park, I witnessed this scene:</p>

<p>Two magpies stood watching a hedgehog. The hedgehog was walking &mdash; slowly and very precisely &mdash; along the white line of a football pitch. The mapgies kept about half a metre from the hedgehog, but walked along behind it, watching it intently.</p>

<p>I'm sure that they were probably sizing it up to see if they could eat it, but I couldn't help thinking that &mdash; apart from the fact that they weren't wearing tiny, twee clothes &mdash; it looked like an updated and slightly sinister scene from a Beatrix Potter book.</p>
