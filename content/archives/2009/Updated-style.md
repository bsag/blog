<p>I've been meaning to update the style of the site (again) for a long time, because it had got rather hard to maintain. After spending a lot of time this Christmas migrating the site, the last thing I really wanted was to spend more time tinkering with the style, but it was the best time to do it, so I gritted my teeth and tackled it.</p>

<p>There's not a huge visual difference, but it's much more organised behind the scenes, and uses the Blueprint CSS framework, which is much neater. I think that there's also a bit less markup now.</p>

<p>It's not totally finished, as I've got to polish a few things, and I haven't checked whether it validates, but it's good enough to leave for now.</p>

<p>Oh, and Happy New Year everyone! I'm about to go and show my face downstairs and remind my husband who I am!</p>
