<p>Life seems to have been incredibly busy and tiring recently, but I've just had one of the most peaceful and relaxing afternoons I've experienced in a long time. Mr. Bsag and I sat reading on the sofa with the cats, listening to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Aleyn-June-Tabor/dp/B000005CUH">Aleyn</a> by June Tabor. He read the paper with Bianca lounging gracefully on his lap, while I started my library copy of Kate Rew's <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wild-Swim-Kate-Rew/dp/0852651228/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1243268486&amp;sr=8-1">Wild Swim</a>. I dreamed about how nice it would be to swim off a Hebridean beach or a Cornish tidal pool, while Bella purred in between us, her head and forepaws tucked into the curve of my hip, long whiskers twitching slightly while she dreamed some feline dream.</p>
