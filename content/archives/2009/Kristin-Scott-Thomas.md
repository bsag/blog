<p>It so happens that we seem to have watched an awful lot of films featuring <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000218/">Kristin Scott Thomas</a> recently. First, there was the brilliant, funny <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000218/">Easy Virtue</a>, in which she played a cold, arrogant English aristocrat who was the Mother-in-Law from Hell for the heroine. Then we saw a couple of French films, in which Kristin Scott Thomas played French or bilingual English-French characters: <a href="http://www.blippr.com/movies/234579-Il-Y-A-Longtemps-Que-Je-Taime">I've Loved You So Long</a> and <a href="http://www.blippr.com/movies/131256-Tell-No-One">Tell No One</a>. Admittedly, my French isn't brilliant, but she seemed utterly comfortable with the language, which I'm sure she is, having lived in France since she was a young woman.</p>

<p>It's odd because I've always though of her as a quintessentially English actress (think of her roles in The English Patient or Four Weddings and a Funeral), but actually, she is equally comfortable in French language films, and I've only just discovered that side of her work.</p>

<p>By the way, <a href="http://www.blippr.com/movies/234579-Il-Y-A-Longtemps-Que-Je-Taime">I've Loved You So Long</a> (or Il y a Longtemps Que Je T'aime) is a fantastic film about forgiveness, and Scott Thomas gives a brilliant performance as a woman just released from prison and holding all her emotions inside.</p>
