<p>Here's something I meant to mention a while ago: I've set up my Disqus account (which provides the commenting service here) to allow people to sign in using Twitter. So now &mdash; if you have a Twitter account &mdash; you don't have to have sign up with Disqus or comment as a guest. Instead, you can use your Twitter credentials (via OAuth) to sign in, and as a bonus, you can Tweet your comment automatically.</p>

<p>Give it a try!</p>
