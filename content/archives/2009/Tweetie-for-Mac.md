<p><a href="http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/">Tweetie</a> -- a Twitter client for Mac OS X (the 'desktop' version, as I suppose we must refer to it now) -- was released today. I use Tweetie for the iPhone, and like it so much that -- until now -- I tended to access Twitter on the iPhone rather than the Mac, even if I was sitting in front of my computer. It's difficult to define exactly what is so good about it, but the smooth behaviour, beautifully designed user interface and carefully thought-out features all conspire to make Twitter much more fun to use than it would otherwise be.</p>

<p>Twitter for Mac does not use quite the same design, but brings the same design sensibility, and is equally fantastic. When I started to use Twitter, I used <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">Twitterific</a>, but while I liked it, it niggled at me in certain ways. I then switched between a variety of Twitter clients, most of which I stopped using fairly quickly because they also didn't sit right with me in one way or another.</p>

<p>Twitter is such a simple and well-defined thing that you'd think it would be easy to design a good Twitter client, but it really isn't. In my opinion, a good Twitter app needs to be there instantly when you want to read tweets or post something, but stay out of your way the rest of the time. I'm with <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/04/20/tweetie-mac">John Gruber</a>: I think Tweetie does that wonderfully. I thought I would miss Growl notifications or beeps when new tweets arrived, but I've found that I don't. The menu bar item turns blue when something new is waiting (you can tailor what triggers the notification), which is just enough to be a notification, without distracting you. The hotkey to trigger the main window is great for quickly summoning or dismissing the window to read tweets, and I love having a separate window and hotkey for writing them. In short, I really like Tweetie, and I'm happy to have the 'Twitter Experience' I love (I can't quite believe I've just typed that) on my Mac as well as my iPhone.</p>
