<p>Today was my first day back at work after the holiday, and I wasn't looking forward to it with any great enthusiasm. As I got up, the news on the radio was full of doom and gloom (death and destruction in Gaza, economic collapse etc.) and reported that today is supposedly one of the most depressing days of the year. It was also snowing and icy, which meant that I had to get the train to work -- another prospect that I didn't relish given the propensity of our rail network to seize up at the first hint on inclement weather.</p>

<p>As I walked to the station, I put on my headphones and set the iPhone to shuffle to try to cheer myself up with a bit of music.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>iPhone:</strong> Chris Thomas King: Hard Time Killing Floor Blues...</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Et tu, iPhone?</p>

<p>They've all got it in for me, I tell you...</p>
