<p>I've just revived my old <a href="http://tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> tumblelog, <a href="http://bsag.tumblr.com/">slipstream</a>. The latest version of Tumblr has some very nice features, and now with Disqus, I can get commenting working there too with very little difficulty. I'm probably going to use it for short posts and links (particularly for photographs, audio and video posts, as Tumblr is set up nicely for those) and leave this blog for longer articles. That's the plan anyway! I've gone through several different styles on slipstream over the past week or so, so the appearance may well change again before I feel comfortable with it...</p>
