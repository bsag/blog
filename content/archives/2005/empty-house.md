<p>Perhaps it's because---at current house prices---we can't begin to imagine ever being able to afford our own home that we find a particular kind of property programme so masochistically irresistible. In particular, I'm drawn to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/homes/tv_and_radio/htrah_index.shtml">How to Rescue a House</a> like a moth to a flame, because that shimmering mirage of the perfect wreck that you could buy for a song and 'do up' is so tempting. How To Rescue A House is a bit different to many of the shows because it doesn't feature property developers who just want to make as much profit as possible before moving on to the next place. All the people looking for a property want a home to live in, and generally can't afford to get one in their area for a price that they can afford. It's also an excellent reminder of the scandalous waste of perfectly decent---and often architecturally interesting---homes that are just lying empty in our cities, while identical mock tudor shoeboxes spread like a rash over former green field sites.</p>

<p>However, my other reason for liking the programme is because of the glimpses of people's lives that you get through their abandoned homes. It can be achingly sad and intimate, particularly when the former owner has lived there for many years and moulded the house into their shape like an old overcoat. One house belonged to a person who had gone into hospital suddenly, obviously expecting to return, but had ended up in a nursing home. An unwashed mug sat on a table, and there was a wooden chair in front of the gas fire, still with the imprint of the owner on the faded beige cushion. Tattered net curtains at the kitchen window seemed to have been repaired haphazardly by spiders' webs, and a quiet layer of dust settled on every surface.</p>

<p>It made me itch to get in there with a camera and document it all, which made me feel slightly guilty. But how would you feel if you bought the house? Clearing away a life like that would feel like clearing away a person's memories, and then erasing any vestiges of the person themselves.</p>
