<p>I'm a bit late with this, but the PowerBook 100 made it to <a href="http://www.mobilepcmag.com/features/2005_03/top100gadgets-5.html">number one</a> of Mobile PC magazine's Top 100 Gadgets of all time. Obviously, I have good taste. I've got a PowerBook 100 sitting in a cupboard, and it was the machine  &mdash;  bought second-hand  &mdash;  that I wrote my thesis on. I was very fond of it, despite the persistently squeaky trackball that I never managed to silence. I slaved over it, played an inordinate amount of Tetris on it, and it even survived having a terracotta plant pot fall on it  &mdash;  a tough little machine.</p>
