<p>One thing I've noticed since living in Birmingham is the number of names of shops and businesses that feature puns. Of course there's the usual hairdressers' names &mdash; like A Cut Above or Curl Up 'N' Dye &mdash; but then you expect hairdressers to use puns (for some reason I've never been able to fathom).</p>

<p>No, what's unusual here is the diversity of other businesses employing a finely-honed play on words in their name. Here's a few of my favourites:</p>

<ul>
<li>Petshop Lads &mdash; a pet shop, obviously, and it took me a few seconds to get that one</li>
<li>Woodfellas &mdash; a firm of carpenters</li>
<li>Melon Cauli &mdash; a greengrocer</li>
</ul>

<p>I must also mention another wonderful shop name which isn't a pun, but is just wonderfully, gloriously weird: Jeff's Useful Shop. What do they sell? Why, Useful Things of course.</p>
