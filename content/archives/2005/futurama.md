<p>I <strong>love</strong> <a href="http://www.gotfuturama.com/">Futurama</a>. We got given a box set of Season 3 at Christmas, and we're slowly working our way through the episodes, helpless with laughter. In many ways, I prefer it to The Simpsons. I've just watched <a href="http://www.gotfuturama.com/Information/Capsules/3ACV17/">A Pharaoh to Remember</a>, in which Bender has a bit of a hissy fit because he thinks no-one will remember him. His friends try to cheer him up by organising a surprise funeral for him, but he criticises all the eulogies from his coffin ("Loud-er and sad-der"), and eventually storms off ("This is the worst funeral ever!"). They all get captured and forced into slavery when delivering a block of sandstone to Osiris 4. While they are in the slave ship, in chains, Fry complains to Leela,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fry: You know the worse thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.</p>
<p>Leela: That's the <strong>only</strong> thing about being a slave.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Priceless.</p>
