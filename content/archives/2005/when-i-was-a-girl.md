<p>"What's that you said? Yes, grandaughter, I remember the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4252421.stm">Ikea riots</a> of '05. Oh, terrible it was. There were flaming bags of GLIMMA being hurled over the BILLY barricades, then exploding in a waxy splash on the AMORF. KLACKBOs were being fashioned into makeshift trebuchet to chuck RESPEKT at those packed into the warehouse. I even saw one woman use a KLIPPAN on a trolley as a battering ram. Shocking. Of course, back in those days, Ikea just sold reasonably priced furniture, not like today."</p>
