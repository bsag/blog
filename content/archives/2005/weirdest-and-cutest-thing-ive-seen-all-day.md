<blockquote>
<p>'When we released Owen into the enclosure, he lumbered to the tortoise which has a dark gray color similar to grown up hippos,' Sabine Baer, rehabilitation and ecosystems manager at the park, told Reuters.</p>

<p>I'm ashamed to say that when I first saw the photo, I thought it was a Photoshop job because I hadn't noted the fact that it's a baby hippo and a very old (and therefore very large) tortoise. Poor tortoise &mdash; at his age he was probably enjoying just pottering around slowing and eating lettuce, and now he's being pestered by a hippo.</p>
