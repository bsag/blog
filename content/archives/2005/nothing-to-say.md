<p>I don't really have anything worthwhile to add to the thousands of words written about the London bombings yesterday. I was working at home yesterday and listening to the radio when the news came in. My first thought was "Oh no, not again." My Dad used to work in London, and throughout the 80s, I used to worry frantically whenever I heard about IRA bombs in London. It's the same old brutality, just carried out more efficiently.</p>

<p>It's a natural reaction when something like this happens for people to ask if your friends and family are OK. I'm glad to be able to say they are, but that's not really the point. It doesn't matter whose family or friends they are &mdash; or, for that matter, what country the deaths or injuries occur in. They are all humans, and we are all affected.</p>
