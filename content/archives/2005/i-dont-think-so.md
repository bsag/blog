<p class="img-shadow"><img src="http://www.rousette.org.uk/ee/images/uploads/unlikely_weather.png" border="0" title="It's what?" /></p><p>I think that my Dashboard Weather widget has taken a bit of a funny turn. This is what it was reading last night (yes, I did manually refresh it) for Birmingham. That's Birmingham, UK, not Birmingham, Alabama, and 30 degrees Centigrade, not Fahrenheit. It was also just after 10pm, and nowhere near 30 degrees. Hmmm.</p>
