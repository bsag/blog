<p><em>[The Great Escape, day three: written 13th August, 2005]</em></p>

<p>Coming around the rim of the former quarry in which the Eden Project is situated feels like entering the set of a <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/2005/04/10/vintage-sci-fi/">Doctor Who</a> episode. The two enormous Biodomes sit in the bottom of the quarry like giant alien eggs. At any moment, I expected to see Christopher Eccleston striding along in his leather coat. Well, a girl can dream...</p>

<p>I think that Tim Smit is one of my new heroes. As well as renovating the excellent <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/2005/08/20/the-lost-gardens-of-heligan/">Lost Gardens of Heligan</a>, he was also the instigator of the <a href="http://www.edenproject.com/">Eden Project</a>. Somehow, he managed to persuade investors that he could build two giant bubbles in a former quarry, one of which would house a tropical rainforest, complete with a waterfall. Oh, and it would be educational, informing people about conservation issues all over the world. Eden somehow manages to get these messages across---along with a passion for plants---without it ever sounding like you need to be someone who knits their own muesli to appreciate it.</p>

<p>The exhibits and labels show wit, creativity and scholarship, and include folklore and myths about plants, as well as scientific facts. The whole place is playful (as you can see from some of my photos <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bsag/sets/777538/">here</a>), and you explore each area with a genuine curiosity to see what's around the corner &mdash; just like Heligan. </p>

<p>The giant tropical biodome is a marvel, that rivals some cathedrals for its ability to inspire awe. However, I managed to come away with a more tangible reminder of the day; I got badly bitten by mosquitoes (goodness only knows how). That doesn't seem to bode well for my trip to the real tropics in September.</p>
