<p>It's that dreaded exam marking time of year again. In universities all over the country, academics can be heard pacing around their offices and muttering things like "Come <strong>on</strong>! Just one more script, then you can have a break." to themselves. I don't know what it is about marking, but it's one of the most severe procrastination generators that I'm faced with in my daily life.</p>

<p>There are a number of things that make almost anything more attractive than the prospect of marking scripts:</p>

<ol>
<li>There are so many of them. I don't have as many as some of my colleagues, but even so the 'unmarked' pile seems to get bigger rather than smaller as you progress.</li>
<li>My handwriting is pretty bad, but trying to decipher the scrawl of stressed students who are trying to write as much as possible in three hours makes your eyes go funny.</li>
<li>If you're marking one question, you see more or less the same essay with minor variations over and over again.</li>
<li>It's really important that you get it right.</li>
</ol>

<p>The last one is the real kicker: the students have (mostly) worked really hard, and you want to be fair and give their efforts the attention they deserve.</p>

<p>While I was marking<sup>1</sup>, I came up with a 'procrastination index' to apply to unpleasant tasks. The idea is that you think of the everyday task that &mdash; under normal circumstances &mdash; would be the very last thing that you would want to do. Mine was cleaning the oven of burnt-on fish pie. Then you compare the current task and see if you would rather do this baseline task or your current one. I decided that I would rather clean the oven twice than mark scripts, so the procrastination index was +200. Fortunately, I was in the office, so I didn't have the opportunity to take that way out. I just had to grit my teeth and slap myself every time my mind or body strayed to any task not related to marking. Roll on the end of the pile...</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> I'm sure that some of you will have spotted that this was a form of procrastination in itself.</p>
