<p>I've had one of those weekends where almost everything I've tried to do on the computer or with anything electronic has gone wrong. My computer has crashed twice while I was in the process of putting it to sleep, some work I was trying to do on Tracks <a href="http://dev.rousette.org.uk/changeset/68" title="The 'BROKEN' title says it all">hasn't worked out</a> and I don't know why, and &mdash; most aggravatingly of all &mdash; my phone keeps crashing.</p>

<p>By lunchtime today, I had reached my tolerance limit, and wanted to deal with something for a few hours that couldn't crash. Some friends of ours are in the process of moving house, and have been tidying up the garden and dividing plants. They came round this morning to give us some of their spare plants<sup>1</sup>. So we spent a very therapeutic few hours in the garden, weeding, planting and trying to rip ivy out<sup>2</sup>. Ivy is amazing stuff; as you pull big lumps of it out, more seems to appear from nowhere, like one of those handkerchief ropes old-fashioned magicians produce from people's ears.</p>

<p>The garden is looking surprisingly neat now, and delving about in non-crashing soil for a while did me the world of good. We also found a gorgeous bee on one of the new plants. It had beautiful orange 'fur' on its thorax and abdomen, and its head and legs looked like black velvet. I've just looked it up and found out that it's a <a href="http://www.insectpix.net/Andrena_fulva.htm" title="A lovely photograph of Andrena fulva">Tawny mining bee (<em>Andrena fulva</em>)</a>. I hope it likes its new home.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>Further note to non-gardening geeks: like trying to get rid of spyware.</p>
