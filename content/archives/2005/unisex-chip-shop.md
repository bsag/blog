<p>I owe a huge debt to <a href="http://www.greynotebook.com/blog/?p=862">jb</a> for pointing to this video of Billy Bragg and Bill Bailey singing Bill's Billy Bragg song, <a href="http://www.leftfield.coop/Media/Player.aspx?MediaId=7&amp;IsHigh=True">Unisex Chip Shop</a> at Glastonbury. I'm sure that I've said so before, but Bill Bailey is a genius. He can be more like Billy Bragg than Billy is, and lines like this are pure comedy gold:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
[Previous line concerned him dreaming about Debbie from the chip shop running naked through the woods of Rainham...]
If I had some tigers I'd train 'em
To protect her
From the sexual fascism that was lurking
'Round the gherkins
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's made me smile every time I think of it.</p>
