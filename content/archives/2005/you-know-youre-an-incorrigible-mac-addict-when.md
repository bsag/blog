<ol>
<li>...you order <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Tiger</a> reflexively on the day pre-orders are announced, and then mark 29th April on the calendar with the words "Tiger arrives", adding more exclamation marks than are strictly becoming for a woman of your age.</li>
<li>...you find out that a new Apple Store is opening <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/retail/bullring/week/20050417.html">in your home town</a>, and go out of your way to walk past the closed shop, <em>just to look at it</em>. You do this despite the fact that you generally detest shopping and shopping centres. You also realise that the opening night coincides with a party that you're going to, and you make elaborate but impractical plans to try to get in to the Apple Store when it opens (and perhaps get a free Apple T-shirt!), and yet still make it to the party.</li>
