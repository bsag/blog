<p>Just a 'heads up' for anyone here who is following Tracks development; I've released <a href="http://rousette.org.uk/projects/downloads/18/tracks-102a">Tracks 1.02</a>.</p>

<p>Since I released version 1.01 in January, it has been dowloaded 1,111 times (neat number!), and the previous version was downloaded 189 times. Of course, only a tiny minority of those people will be actually using Tracks, but I'm still chuffed &mdash; and amazed &mdash; that it is continuing to gather so much interest.</p>
