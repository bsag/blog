<p>We left it a bit late to buy a tree this year, and the nearest outlet had sold out. So, while I was busy blowing air into <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/2005/12/22/qualified/">rubber mannequins</a>, Mr. Bsag got to do the <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/2004/12/18/bringing-home-the-tree/">caveman</a> bit this year, and had to trek a bit further with it. He also got a real bargain because they were trying to get rid of their stock. We got an enormous and gloriously bushy tree (as you can more or less see from the blurry photograph) for the princely sum of Â£7---bargain!</p>

<p>We're going to take a couple of days off to eat, drink and scare ourselves deliciously with all the BBC4 ghost stories and Conan Doyle stuff we've been recording on the EyeTV. Happy Christmas, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festivus">Festivus</a>, Winter Solstice, or whatever else you feel like celebrating (or not celebrating) to you all. (Imagine that I just said that exactly like the Queen, complete with that funny, forced little grimace she makes at the end of her speech).</p>
