<p>I don't know what it is about the weather today, but I've been generating massive amounts of static electricity in the office. The combination of dry, cold air, an acrylic fleece and a synthetic carpet must be nearly optimal conditions for generating static, because every time I touch anything in the office (light switch, sockets, poor shocked PowerBook), sparks crackle from my fingers like I'm some kind of human <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/vdg2.htm">Van der Graaff generator</a>.</p>

<p>It's got to the point where I'm aversively conditioned towards metal objects. Every time I look at the light switch I feel a little knot of fear. I actually contemplated not switching the lights off when I left the office this evening, <em>because it hurts</em>. I can see that I'm going to have to wear a very long version of one of those grounding straps around my wrist, with the other end attached to the radiator.</p>
