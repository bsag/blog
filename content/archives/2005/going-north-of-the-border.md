<p>I'm off to not-so-sunny (current temperature 13Â°C) Edinburgh for a week-long conference, so updates may be sparse unless I manage to blag some free WiFi<sup>1</sup>. Does anyone know of any good, free WiFi hotspots in the city centre?</p>

<p>I'm giving two talks, and it's a conference outside my discipline, so it should be... interesting.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Mr. Bsag calls me 'WiFi' every now and again. I hope he means 802.11g, not 802.11b &mdash; I'd hate to be nearly defunct.</p>
