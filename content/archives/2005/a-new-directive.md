<p>The conductor (or whatever they're called now) made his way up the aisle of each carriage on the train this evening, asking people to identify each of the bags stashed on the overhead racks. Later, he reminded people to keep their bags with them at all times, and said that the 'identifying bags on racks' was a new directive.</p>

<p>Mr. Bsag phoned me before I left work and told me about the latest incidents in London (I'd been busy all day, and hadn't heard). He's got to go to London tomorrow, so we talked about that a bit. I blurted out "Well, you be careful" before I realised how silly that was. Being careful doesn't really help &mdash; we all just need to be lucky.</p>

<p>I suppose that this is the way things will be now.</p>
