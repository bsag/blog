<div class=img-shadow><img src="http://www.rousette.org.uk/images/uploads/geek_love_poem-ladies.jpg" border="0" alt="image" name="image" width="220" height="198" /></div><p>Remember last year, around Valentine's Day, when I mentioned a rather wonderful <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/2004/02/08/nothing-says-i-love-you-like-hexadecimal/">geeky Valentine's poem</a>? Probably not, but as you see from the magnificent image here, you can now get it on a T-shirt at <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts/ladies/724f/">ThinkGeek</a>. I like the fact that the hex codes are visually colour coded. I like the fact that they make it in a women's fitted-T style. And I really, really want one.</p>
