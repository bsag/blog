<p>I spent a bit of time at the weekend finishing the main work of updating Tracks to use Ajax to edit, create and delete items. For those of you who don't know what Ajax is, it's basically some clever Javascript that allows you to make changes to the database and show those changes 'live' without having to refresh the whole page. It makes the whole thing much more like a normal application, rather than a web application.</p>

<p>For those of you keeping up with Tracks development, I've put a couple of silly movies showing me editing projects in the new interface <a href="http://rousette.org.uk/projects/screenshots/22/movies-of-new-ajax-features">here</a>. You can have a good laugh at my typos &mdash; typing while recording live is surprisingly tricky.</p>

<p>On a side note, I'm using <a href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/snapzprox/">Snapz Pro</a> to make the movies. It's incredibly good, and while I'm just using a demo version at the moment, I think I'll pony up for a licence.</p>
