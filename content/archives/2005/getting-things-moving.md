<p><a href="http://www.43folders.com/">Merlin</a> has &mdash; as ever &mdash; some <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/05/cringebusting_y.html">great tips</a> for getting those stubborn, been-there-forever tasks off your list. As well as containing the glorious phrase "plane some cringe off of your hated tasks", which would look great on a T-shirt, he suggests identifying the tasks that make you cringe then trying to work out <strong>why</strong>.</p>

<p>I've had an embarrassing number of those kinds of tasks that manage to linger on the list for ages, which was the main motivation for planning a feature in Tracks to <a href="http://dev.rousette.org.uk/ticket/8">flag them up</a>. It's weird but I often find that when I do eventually get around to doing those 'cringe items' they turn out to be easy and trivial, and I don't have a clue why I was hung up on them for so long.</p>

<p>On a semi-related note, there was a great <a href="http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/archive/dilbert-20050524.html">Dilbert</a> cartoon today about the work-life balance.</p>
