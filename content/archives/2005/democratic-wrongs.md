<p>Well, for what it's worth, I've executed my democratic rights. I can't say that trying to find the least worst party (if you'll forgive my contorted syntax) feels very good. Mr. Bsag on the other hand didn't even get that opportunity. We submitted a form to get ourselves on the electoral register when we moved, but when my polling card had arrived and his hadn't, he called the Council. After a long delay, they got back to him and said that they did have a record of our application, but because of a 'clerical error' he hadn't been entered on the register. Oh, and it was too late to do anything about it. Great. So much for democracy in action.</p>
