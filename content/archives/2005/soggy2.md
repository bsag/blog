<p>Well, I suppose it's nice that it might be sunny at the weekend, but there's a good few days of very soggy walks back from the railway station there. Last night I discovered that, while my rucksack in which I lug my laptop is shower-proof, it is in no way downpour-proof. Just about everything got a soaking yesterday---I had wet clothes, squelching socks and even wet bank notes. As I stood on the doormat, dripping quietly, I once again wished for a personal, rain-proof force field, but I suppose I'll have to make do with a GoreTex jacket for now, like everyone else.</p>
