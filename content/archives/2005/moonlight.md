<p>I had to get up in the very early hours of this morning to use the bathroom, and was amazed by finding the bathroom full of moonlight. The full moon was a couple of days ago, and the room was dappled by shards of silver light, broken up by the patterned, etched glass in the window. I went into Mr. Bsag's studio and watched the blue shadows of the trees outside dance on the walls.</p>

<p>Sometimes it's easy to forget about the moon, but that just means that it's a delightful surprise when you come upon it unexpectedly.</p>
