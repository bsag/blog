<p>For a number of reasons, I've had some niggling worries on my mind recently. None have been particularly earth-shattering, but they were annoying enough that I've been mildly gloomy and pre-occupied, as if I've been walking around with a small stone in my shoe. I had a very busy day yesterday, but suddenly almost all of the things which had been bugging me resolved themselves &mdash; just like that. To top it all, the weather &mdash; which had been grey, wet and oppressive all day &mdash; abruptly changed for the better, and everything sparkled in the brilliant light.</p>

<p>I ended the day with a little celebration at work with some colleagues (involving a certain quantity of alcohol, which doubtless helped a bit), and left for home feeling like a different person. I started to read a book on the train, but then just let myself daydream, looking out of the window and enjoying the odd, weightless, connected and yet disconnected feeling.</p>

<p>The train was nearly empty, and opposite me a man in a suit sat with his briefcase on his lap. His hands were resting gently on his copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0330491431/butshesagirl-21">"The CEO of the Sofa" by P.J. O'Rourke</a>, and his chin touched his chest as he slept. I felt slightly guilty about watching him while he slept, but he looked so peaceful and still that I was fascinated.</p>
