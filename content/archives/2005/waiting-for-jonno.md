<p>Lyle is <a href="http://www.dummies-for-destruction.co.uk/random/index.php/?p=3067">right</a>---we get a few days of rain and the so-called railway system collapses. My train was delayed on the way home because (apparently) they were 'awaiting train crew', and while we were sitting endlessly at New Street waiting for this mythical entity I got to hear a kind of 'perfect storm' of train delays.</p>

<p>Every single announcement involved a delay or cancellation. There were floods in Carlisle, power outages in Lockerbie and other trains also awaiting train crew in other places (have they all been abducted by aliens, or something?). The perfect piece of disruption recursion was the announcement of a delay because the train bringing the crew to the train in question was also delayed. I wondered for a moment how far this went back, and whether it's possible to bring the entire railway system to a standstill if one driver decides to bunk off and spend the day in bed.</p>
