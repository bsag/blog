<p>Yesterday was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphany_%28feast%29">Epiphany</a> (or so the hubby tells me, and he knows about these things), which meant that the Christmas decorations were supposed to come down. I always find it a rather sad a dreary time. Taking decorations down is <em>much</em> less fun than putting them up, and everything looks so drab in contrast.</p>

<p>The worst job was getting the fairy lights off our <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/2004/12/18/bringing-home-the-tree/">rite of passage</a> tree. I thought when I got them out of the box in their super-compressed state that the chances of getting them back into the same box were vanishingly small. I don't know if you've noticed, but fairy lights behave like DNA. In the box, they are in their <a href="http://www.rothamsted.bbsrc.ac.uk/notebook/courses/guide/chromo.htm">supercoiled, chromosomal form</a>. As soon as you unwind them, they explode into a tangle of wires; unlike DNA, this is a strictly one-way process.</p>

<p>I made a half-hearted attempt to form loose coils, but realised this was a losing battle and resorted to cramming the whole lot in a huge plastic bag. <em>That's</em> going to be fun next year.</p>
