<p>I spotted a link to a site called <a href="http://www.liveplasma.com/">Liveplasma.com</a> on the <a href="http://forum.textdrive.com/viewtopic.php?id=3147">Textdrive forum</a>, which claimed that it mapped similarities between bands or artists in a linked-node-and-path-type graphic. I like a lot of rather dissimilar bands, but also some who have particular connections to one another (like Mouthmusic and Talitha MacKenzie and Martyn Bennett, as one example), so I decided to check it out.</p>

<p>I problems with it in Safari, but it worked fine in Firefox. At least, I think it did... Off the top of my head, I decided to start with Kate Bush. She's had some interesting collaborations over the years, and I thought for sure that it would display Peter Gabriel close to her node.</p>

<p>Gabriel did indeed appear close by, as did some other similar artists like Bryan Ferry and David Bowie, but there was also a band called Krokus quite nearby. I'd never heard of them, so I did a search on Krokus out of curiousity. <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/ee/images/uploads/bizzaro.png">This image</a> shows the result. How &mdash; in the name of Wuthering Heights &mdash; did Kate end up orbiting Iron Maiden and Mettalica like a small lost moon? Is there some bootleg heavy metal version of the Hounds of Love that I'm not aware of? I tell you, it's keeping me awake at night.</p>
