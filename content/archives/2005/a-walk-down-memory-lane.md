<p>Mr. D. <a href="http://www.aprosexic.com/2005/06/walk-down-memory-lane.html">tagged me</a> with this particular meme, so here we go. I'm going to do it a bit half-heartedly, because I'm starved of inspiration for the '5 things...' bits at the end.</p>

<h4>10 years ago...</h4>

<p>I was in the final year of my PhD, in the agonising and seemingly endless process of writing up my thesis. It was quite a time of transition. When you've spent so much time working on something so intense and rather narrow, you really want to be rid of it, and yet don't want to let it go &mdash; it's a strange feeling. I was also trying to work out whether I would be able to make a living from this academia malarky. Actually, I'm still wondering about that...</p>

<h4>5 years ago...</h4>

<p>This was another rather momentous year &mdash; Mr. Bsag and I got married! The whole year was a bit of a whirlwind. I went to New Caledonia for field work in the Spring, then came straight back to a marriage preparation weekend. I wouldn't recommend spending quite a long time abroad and living in a tent, and then immediately spending a night somewhere that isn't your own home. You wake up in the morning wondering where the heck you are, what time it is, and which way up you are. Anyway, despite all the hassle, I remember that year very fondly.</p>

<h4>1 year ago...</h4>

<p>Obviously the big events in my life happen at five year intervals; one year ago, I started the year in deep depression because I thought I was <em>never</em> going to get a job, then I landed my current job (to my everlasting surprise and delight), and we moved from Oxford to Birmingham. Just about this time last year, we were in that transitional moving house stage, wandering around our flat and wondering how we were ever going to fit everything in a van.</p>

<h4>Yesterday...</h4>

<p>I had a bit of a busy day yesterday, which involved a lot of running around with video equipment, and included giving a talk. I think it went down fairly well. In the evening, we watched 'Young Adam' on DVD. I wasn't wowed by the characters, but I loved the photography and David Byrne's soundtrack. I spent most of the film trying to think of Ewan McGregor films (other than the Star Wars prequels), in which he <strong>doesn't</strong> show us his dangly bits. I suspect it's a very short list.</p>

<h4>Today...</h4>

<p>Another day of running around, followed by a slightly desperate attempt to come up with 2000 characters to describe what I hope to be doing in the next year. Try it &mdash; it's not easy.</p>

<h4>Tomorrow...</h4>

<p>I've got a pile of things in Tracks which are showing up with an embarrassing yellow highlight, which means that they are starting to fester on the list. My goal for tomorrow is to get the worst of them off the list, so that I can enjoy another weekend away without guilt.</p>

<p>So there you have it. <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/2005/05/18/musical-baton/">Last time</a> I tried to pass a meme like this on to other people, I managed to make a right hash of it. So this time, I'll just throw the comments open to the first five people who fancy tackling it themselves. It will also give those who don't have their own blogs a chance to join in. I'm curious to know how the last 10 years has treated all of you.</p>
