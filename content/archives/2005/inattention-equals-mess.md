<p>I'm definitely trying to think about too many things at once at the moment. Yesterday, I loaded up my pod coffee machine with water and coffee pods, and then switched it on while I raced to finish an urgent email I was dealing with. A tiny part of my brain commented that the machine seemed to be making an unusual sound, but the rest of my brain told it to shut up and concentrate on the email.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, I reached over to grab my coffee cup, only to realise that it wasn't there. The tiny drip tray, however, was copiously overflowing with lovely, steaming hot java, and the surface of the filing cabinet on which the machine sits had developed a very fine <em>crema</em>.</p>

Curses.
