<p>Peter Cooper <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/2005/07/29/freak-weather/#comment-3957">alerted me</a> to the fact that he'd made some huge changes to RSS Digest (the service I used to display my del.icio.us link on this page) and it had emerged---like a butterfly from a chrysalis---to become <a href="http://www.feeddigest.com/">FeedDigest</a>.</p>

<p>I found some time to sign up for the new service today, and I'm really blown away by it. For a start, it's <strong>much</strong> quicker than it used to be (not that the speed ever bothered me much), and there are loads of new features like combining feeds, slick templating features, and a host of different output formats.</p>

<p>The free account gives you up to 5 digests from up to 3 sources, so you can try it out and see if you like it. I think you'll be hooked. Apart from anything else, it's worth signing up just to see Peter's wonderful way with Ajax alert boxes. Needless to say, I'm jealous.</p>
