<p>It was slightly unfortunate that we left Japan about two weeks before the cherry blossom season really kicked in. We saw one or two isolated (but very beautiful) trees, but there's nothing like the full on effect of blossom <em>en masse</em> to make you feel as if Spring has well and truly sprung.</p>

<p>Anyway, I've been really enjoying the flickr tag <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/blossom">'blossom'</a> recently, so I thought it was about time to spread some vernal feeling around.</p>
