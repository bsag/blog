<p>I've had a pretty busy weekend, as my parents came up to stay, and we met up with Mr. Bsag's parents (plus our two brothers) for a pre-Christmas dinner on Saturday. On early Friday evening, we wandered around the Frankfurt Christmas Market in Birmingham, and managed to just about eat our own weight in free samples of stollen (fruity, spicy Christmas bread). The lights around the Bullring and the Christmas market looked quite striking, and I put a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bsag/72452124/">few</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bsag/72452125/">photos</a> up on flickr. Then on Saturday, we visited Lichfield for the big lunch, and took a bit of time wandering around the town and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bsag/72452128/">the</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bsag/72452126/">Cathedral</a>. It's a very unusual style of architecture, and is a huge size for such a small town. There's nothing quite as lovely as seeing the low winter sun slanting in through stained glass windows, and warming the stone.</p>
