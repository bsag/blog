<p>There's a noise in the background of 'Rental Car' by Beck (on the album 'Guero') that sounds really like our doorbell. The sad part about this is that I've now been fooled by it twice within a matter of minutes; both times I actually got up to answer the the door.</p>

<p>I blame having my head filled to bursting point with unfamiliar, technical, complex and difficult stuff over the past week. It's obvious that some of that information is going to have to leak out of my head before normal functioning is resumed.</p>
