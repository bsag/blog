<p>Although we were away at the weekend, we caught some of the later parts of the Live8 concert. I wasn't that keen on many of the bands featured &mdash; I was much more excited by the concert featuring African musicians at the Eden Centre &mdash; but I did want to see Pink Floyd. Actually, since it was 24 years since they had last played together, I was a bit concerned that they might be dreadfully, embarrassingly bad.</p>

<p>Obviously that was a foolish fear. Pink Floyd blew away all of the other bands &mdash; even The Who. Their playing was tight and focussed, and the level of passion and feeling they got into the music was &mdash; to use the original sense of the word &mdash; awesome. I hope that the Scissor Sisters were suitably humbled after hearing 'Comfortably Numb' done the <em>right</em> way<sup>1</sup>. Nick Mason may look like he should be handing out <a href="http://www.mrsbrowns.co.uk/acatalog/WERTHERS_ORIGINALS.html">Werther's Originals</a> to adoring grandchildren rather than sitting behind a drum kit, and Roger Waters looks disturbingly like Smashy (or Nicey &mdash; I can't remember which was the blonde one), but they still rocked. They are also nice blokes, and have agreed to donate the profits of their increased album sales to charity.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> I love my husband dearly, but the closest I've ever got to wondering if I'd married the right person was when he said that he <em>quite liked</em> the Scissor Sisters version. You think you know someone... Thankfully, he has since recanted.</p>
