<p>I'm back. I'm very tired but I had a fantastic, productive, awe-inspiring time in Brazil. Right now I'm ploughing through a huge pile of emails, but once I've sorted myself out a bit, slept, eaten some real veggie food for the first time in three weeks (most emphatically <em>not</em> rice and beans), and of course caught up with the hubbie, I'll start writing about some of the great experiences I've had.</p>
