<p>I don't know why, but the Birmingham area seems to have become the Freak Weather Capital of the UK. First, there was the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2275158.stm">Dudley earthquake</a> in 2002, and now we've had the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/4726643.stm">Moseley tornado</a>. What's next &mdash; typhoons on the lake in the local park?</p>
