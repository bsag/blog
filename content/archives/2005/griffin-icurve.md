<p>I've usually found working on my 12" PowerBook very comfortable, but recently I've started to feel that my posture is beginning to deteriorate. I already use an external keyboard and mouse at work, so I felt that raising the screen up higher would help me to keep my shoulders back and my back in a more natural position. I could have gone the DIY route and propped my laptop up on a couple of phone directories, but I decided to do it properly and get a <a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/icurve/index.php">Griffin iCurve</a>.</p>

<p>It's a very low key design---basically just a length of bent and curved polycarbonate. However, it's much more solid and substantial than you might guess from looking at pictures of it, and seems to place the laptop in more or less the perfect position. The top 'prongs' tilt at an angle of about 5-10Â°, but non-slip rubber patches stop the laptop from slipping off. Another advantage is that the PowerBook is almost completely exposed to the air, and as a result the average CPU temperature (as measured by <a href="http://www.iconfactory.com/ip_home.asp">iPulse</a>) has dropped by a few degrees, which can only be a good thing for the life of the processor.</p>

<p>I'm hoping that I might gain a few precious centimetres in height over the next few weeks, as my back learns to uncurl again---I need all the height I can get.</p>
