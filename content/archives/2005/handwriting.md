<p>I have a question: does anyone know of good resources for adults to improve their handwriting? I don't mean calligraphy, but everyday fluent handwriting. I used to have really neat handwriting when I was at school, but as I've used computers more it has gradually degraded to the scruffy, illegible scrawl I use today. When I look back at my old school books, and even my undergraduate notes, it's hard to believe that it's my handwriting. I'd really like to neaten it up again.</p>

<p>I think part of the problem is impatience. I've got used to typing very quickly, so when I try to hand-write at the same speed, I get frustrated and the result looks like a stoned spider with inky feet reeling across the page.</p>
