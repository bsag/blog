<p>I've just taken delivery of a shiny new iMac G5 20" to replace our creaky old iMac, and some other nice toys like an EyeTV (digital terrestrial version) and Aperture, all courtesy of the great Apple educational prices.</p>

<p>I'd write more, but I've got lovely new geek toys to set up and play with! I'm sure I'll be going on about the experience at great length in due course. Brace yourselves...</p>
