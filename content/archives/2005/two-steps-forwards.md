<p>Do you ever have one of those days when you do a load of work and then find that you have to undo all of it? I do. This afternoon, I was trying to add some kind of authentication to Tracks. I knew what I wanted to do, had a <em>vague</em> idea how to accomplish it, and off I went.</p>

<p>Two hours later, and all I succeeded in doing was making a total pig's ear of the thing. All I can say is thank goodness for <code>svn revert</code>. Time for a beer and a film.</p>
