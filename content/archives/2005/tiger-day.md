<p>OK, I'm so excited, it's just ridiculous. What with getting my copy of Tiger delivered, trying to make it to the opening of the Bullring Apple Store, and <em>then</em> trying to make it to a party (by which time I may be thoroughly geeked out, and even less comprehensible to others than usual), it may be a day before you hear from me again. Or it might be longer if I manage to stuff the installation up...</p>

<p>I hope everyone has fun, but remember to backup first!</p>
