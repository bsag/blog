<p>I got the new issue of <a href="http://macuser.pcpro.co.uk/">MacUser</a> magazine through the post today, and was just flicking through it to see what was being featured when I spotted a report of the <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/2005/10/29/macexpo-2005/">MacExpo</a> which had some pictures of the show. Imagine my surprise to find that I was in one of the photographs! I don't know what the chances are, but when you consider that the show was open for a total of about 24 hours, of which I was present for 4, that there were thousands of people and a huge number of stands, I find it incredible that I'm in one of the shots. Probability is a strange thing.</p>

<p>However, I don't think that even my nearest and dearest would recognise me---it's a distant shot and I have my back to the camera (my best side for portraits, as it happens). It's only because I know what I was wearing and carrying, and remember talking to the people in the photo that I know it's me. It did briefly cross my mind that I could post the image here (if I could avoid getting sued for breach of copyright), and run a 'Spot the Bsag' competition. Visitors could enter their guess (as pixel coordinates of the image) in the comments, and the closest guess would win a fabulous prize<sup id="r1-101105"><a href="#f1-101105">1</a></sup>. It would be like 'Where's Waldo/Wally', with the added challenge of not knowing what Waldo/Wally looks like.</p>

<p><sup id="f1-101105">1</sup> Something in the style of a school fete tombola prize, perhaps, like a packet of Rich Tea biscuits or a bottle of HP Sauce. <a href="#r1-101105">&uarr;</a></p>
