<p>I've finally got around to uploading some of my photos from my Brazil trip this summer to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bsag/sets/72157624847174586/">Flickr</a>. I've always admired wildlife photographers, but this year in particular, I'm in awe of them. It's incredibly difficult to get good shots of animals: even if the animals in question are not particularly shy, they are either moving too fast (how inconsiderate of them) or sitting in the least well-lit spot in any particular landscape.</p>

<p>I had some great opportunities to take photos of some wonderful animals this year, but I still managed to blow it much of the time. I could try to blame the fact that I've got a compact camera with a not very long lens, but the truth is that I just need to be a better photographer. If I got the animal still and in the right place, I managed to forget to set the aperture or ISO appropriately. If I had everything set up perfectly, the animal moved off at the last minute, just before the shot.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope that you enjoy the photos, flawed though they are!</p>
