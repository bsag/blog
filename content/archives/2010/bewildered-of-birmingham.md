<p>I'm back from my travels, in body at least. The good news is that I do not appear to have any invertebrates making a home in my body like last time<sup id="r1-230810"><a href="#f1-230810">1</a></sup>, and I don't even have that many mosquito bites, considering that my bite count is usually around the 50+ mark. However my brain does not appear to have entirely caught up with me after the long hours of travelling across several time zones.</p>

<p>My circadian clock has evidently given up for the time being, until it can work out when, exactly, the sun is rising <em>this</em> week, thank you very much. Consequently my stomach doesn't know when it should be expecting food, and I find myself waking up wondering a) what time it is, b) what continent I'm on and c) why I am not inside a mosquito net.</p>

<p>It will all work itself out eventually. When I know where and when I am again, I'll write about a few of the experiences of this trip, but until then, I leave you with a Puzzling Thing I encountered on one of my many flights.</p>

<p>I'm an obsessive reader, and usually have some form of reading matter at hand while I eat, particularly if I'm eating on my own. When I don't have anything to read, I'll read the labels on packets, jars and bottles instead. So, on a SWISS flight, I found myself idly perusing the label on the wrapping of my cheese sandwich:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Allergy information: May contain traces of lupins, nuts, peanuts, sesame seeds, soya.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wait, what? Lupins?</p>

<p>I immediately thought, of course, of Monty Python and the mighty <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MH5OnkzI6fo">Dennis Moore</a>, which made me giggle and look like a slightly unhinged person laughing at her sandwich wrapping. However, on returning to the welcoming arms of internet access, I find that <a href="http://www.eatwell.gov.uk/healthissues/foodintolerance/foodintolerancetypes/lupinallergy/">lupin allergy</a> is a genuine, serious condition, and that lupin flour is used quite widely in 'mainland Europe'<sup id="r2-230810"><a href="#f2-230810">2</a></sup>. So now I know.</p>

<p>Dennis Moore, Dennis Moore, riding through the night...</p>

<p><sup id="f1-230810">1</sup> I came back with a bot fly larva embedded in my foot last time. <a href="#r1-230810">&uarr;</a></p>

<p><sup id="f2-230810">2</sup> I don't know if it's just me, but I detect a distinct subtext of "those crazy Mainland Europeans, using lupin flour in their bread!" in the reference to mainland Europe on that FSA page. <a href="#r2-230810">&uarr;</a></p>
