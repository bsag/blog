<p>One of the things I really like about cats is that they retain a lot of the independence and behavioural traits of their wild ancestors. I realise that this is often cited by people who <em>don't</em> like cats as one of the things they dislike most about them, but it would be a dull world if we all liked the same things. Having a couple of cats in the house seems as wondrous to me as having a couple of small leopards wandering around in my living room.</p>

<p>I was reminded of this very strongly a few nights ago, when &mdash; in the middle of the night &mdash; Bella strolled up the bed to drape herself along my torso <sup id="r1-50110"><a href="#f1-50110">1</a></sup>. As I was lying on my back, she was actually higher than my head, and I could see her looking down at me in the dark, with her nose a few centimetres from my chin. She was purring loudly, and half-closed her eyes in evident bliss. There's nothing quite as relaxing and cosy on a cold winter night as having a warm, purring cat sleeping on your chest, so I closed my eyes too. After a minute or two, I felt her paw gently pat my cheek, claws retracted, but still faintly perceptible on my skin.</p>

<p>It was a classic domestic cat move: 'I could rip your throat out, but I won't because you're quite comfy and you give me food. And you can be quite amusing sometimes.' Despite being in a rather vulnerable position, her restraint actually made me trust her more than ever, and revel in the delicate path that cats tread between wildness and domesticity.</p>

<p>The truth, of course, is that cats own their humans rather than the reverse (and there is evidence that they <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/28/AR2007062802343.html">domesticated themselves</a>), but I think that it does humans no harm at all to be put in our place by another species every now and again.</p>

<p><sup id="f1-50110">1</sup> She usually sleeps at the bottom of the bed, gradually shifting over the course of the night to sleep <strong>on</strong> my feet. <a href="#r1-50110">&uarr;</a></p>
