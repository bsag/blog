<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>So, I was watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/">The Dark Knight</a> last night (which I rather enjoyed), and we got to the bit where the 'Bat Bike' makes its appearance. As Superhero vehicles go, I rather like the thing, with its gigantic wheels, but I couldn't help thinking the Batman made a poor costume decision.</p> <p /> <p>There he was, vrooming along on the Bat Bike, cape fluttering behind him in the slipstream, dangerously close to the unprotected giant rear wheel. Really, did he not pay attention to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edna_Mode">Edna Mode</a> when she warned of the danger of capes?</p>      <p style="font-size: 10px; color: #666;">  <a href="http://posterous.com">Posted via email</a> from <a href="http://bsag.posterous.com/should-have-listened-to-edna">bsag's posterous</a>  </p>  </div>
