I'm one of those people who finds the Caps Lock key on the keyboard more of an annoyance than a useful feature, so I have recently remapped my Caps Lock to Control. This is now surprisingly easy to do on Snow Leopard: launch System Preferences, choose Keyboard and click the 'Modifier Keys...' button. I'm quite happy with this as I've got a more comfortably-placed Control key, and if I ever need to do a run of all caps characters, I can easily type lowercase and transform to upper case afterwards in most applications.

However, it has made me realise that many people normally type capitals in what I think is a really awkward way. I let a student of mine use my computer to log in to his intranet account to get some information while he was in my office. I warned him in advance that I had remapped my Caps Lock key, and when this received a blank look<sup id="r1-101110"><a href="#f1-101110">1</a></sup>, I tried "the Caps Lock key doesn't work".

> **Him**: But... how can I enter capitals then?<br />
> **Me**: [a bit astounded] Err... use the Shift key.<br />
> **Him**: Which one is that?<br />
> **Me**: The one with the upwards arrow on it. The big one. There! Just to the left of your left-hand little finger!

Then I went through exactly the same routine with another student. This means that whenever they have to type a capital letter (the beginning of every sentence, if I'm lucky) they hit the Caps Lock key, type the character, then hit the Caps Lock key again. 

This astounds me.
