<p style="clear:both;">If there's a possible bright side to the recession, it's the phenomenon of the pop-up shop: local people take over a vacant shop in an otherwise bland and homogenous shopping centre, and suddenly there's a place where you can buy lovely, quirky, one-off, hand-crafted things made by local people.</p>

<p>If you're in Birmingham over the next few weeks, there are two pop-up shops to visit. First there's the Pavilions Pop-up Arts Shop in the Pavilions Shopping Centre, which will only be open 5 days from 2nd-7th April, and features Mr. Bsag's prints, if you'll forgive the obligatory spousal plug. Then there's the <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/bullring-shop/">Created in Birmingham shop</a>, which is in the Bullring Shopping Centre. Both are fine places to have a look at interesting things made by talented people.</p>
