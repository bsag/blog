<p>I'm flying out to Brazil again this afternoon, having <em>finally</em> finished my packing. For new readers, this is a work trip, supervising students doing their final year projects in the Pantanal region of Brazil. I'll be away for 3 weeks, with no internet access, so things will be very quiet here.</p>

<p>Mr. Bsag is looking after hearth, home and the cats while I'm away, and I'll miss all of them dreadfully. I've got endless hours of travelling (3 flights and one 5 hour minibus journey) ahead of me over he next couple of days, so please keep your fingers crossed for me that all my connections connect! </p>
