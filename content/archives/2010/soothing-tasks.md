I've had a very difficult month or so for one reason or another. Nothing earth-shattering, really, just the accumulation of a lot of small problems and set-backs, plus a health scare which turned out to be nothing to worry about eventually, I'm glad to say. In the midst of all this, I noticed something about myself, which I should probably have realised a long time ago: I find solving geeky problems soothing.

I was planning to do it anyway, but [re-structuring the site][] definitely helped to relax me outside of work. I enjoy getting absorbed by a logical problem and trying to understand a system. The key thing is that the system _is_ possible to understand. Unlike dealing with my fellow humans, there are rules, and the rules are logical and can be uncovered by careful debugging<sup id="r1-21110"><a href="#f1-21110">1</a></sup>. I like the fact that I can have control over code, even when I have no control over the rest of my life.

I find that getting absorbed with the knotty problems of how to compile a tags page or write a rake task takes my mind off worrying about other things, over which I have much less control. Looking back at similar periods in my past, I can see the same pattern. Those periods have coincided (entirely un-coincidently) with re-jigging my site, learning another programming language or some other piece of abstruse geekery. In a way, it's self-medication for stress, and I can think of more destructive ways to deal with it.
