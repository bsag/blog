<p>As <a href="http://www.gotfuturama.com/Information/Encyc-18-Farnsworth/" title="Futurama Encyclopedia - Professor Farnsworth">Professor Farnsworth</a> says in Futurama &mdash; Good news everyone!</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_870450.html?menu=news.quirkies" title="Multiple kidney shock">Ananova</a>, two Bosnian brothers have been found to have 4 working kidneys each:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Josip Galic, 69, from Kucetine in Bosnia said: "I had a car accident and doctors discovered I had four kidneys. That surprised me, but at least it explained why I could drink all my friends under the table, and never had a hangover."</p>
<p>He added it was a further surprise when his brother found out after a visit to the doctor that he had four kidneys as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Handy, no? I mean, I know that one of your kidneys is technically a spare since you can function with only one, but multiple backups are definitely the way to go.</p>
