<p>Mr. Bsag's next art exhibition starts tomorrow. He was frantically blasting spray-mount on price labels, while I was trying to produce a new architecture and design for his <a href="http://www.artfall.co.uk" title="Don't look yet - the re-design isn't live">website</a>, and cursing the day I ever decided to use a footer. We had both been slaving away indoors while the sun shone and the breeze blew balmily outside. We had had enough.</p>

<p>"Oh, let's go to the pub". Our local &mdash; the Mason's Arms &mdash; is a lovely, friendly Victorian pub, nestled in the hollow made by a former quarry. It has great real ale, and &mdash; more importantly for our purposes &mdash; a sunny beer garden. Half an hour with a pint or two of beer, a newspaper, listening to birds singing, and basking in the sun was  just sufficient to restore a genial outlook on life.</p>

<p>What would we do without pubs?</p>
