<p>I'm sure that regular readers will have noticed that I've been worried and depressed about my work situation. I've tried not to rant about it too much, but if you aren't in a good state of mind it does show in your writing. So I'm <strong>really</strong> happy to announce that &mdash; after months of rejections, and lying to myself about what I really wanted to be doing in an attempt to convince myself that the situation wasn't as soul-destroying as it seemed &mdash; I've just been offered a great job in academia. I don't want to give too many details right now, but it's right up my street,  and is a permanent job (w00t!) with great potential. It also means that we'll be moving from Oxford. On the downside, I'll miss the beauty of the city, but the trade-off is that we will be able to afford to live somewhere decent: you can't eat the scenery, after all.</p><p>The immense, Atlas-like burden I have been dragging around for months lifted from my shoulders the minute I got the news, and left me feeling light and dizzy. Mr. Bsag and I went out for an impromptu celebration (we plan to have <strong>many</strong> celebrations now that we have a legitimate excuse), and on the way back on the bus, I picked some music on the iPod to fit my mood. I can heartily recommend 'It's the Sun' from <a href="http://www.thepolyphonicspree.com/main.html" title="Lyrics of The Beginning Stages of...">The Beginning Stages Of...</a> by the Polyphonic Spree if you are feeling jubilant:</p><blockquote><p>SUN</p><p>Hope has come, you are safe</p><p>And it makes me cry</p><p>Because I'm on my way</p><p>On my way</p><p>On my way</p><p>Hey, it's the sun and it makes me shine</p></blockquote><p>Right on cue, the evening sun came slanting through the trees, turning everything a blazing gold, and I don't mind admitting I had a bit of a tear in my eye.</p>
