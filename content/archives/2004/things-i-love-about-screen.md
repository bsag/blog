<p><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/" title="screen homepage"><code>screen</code></a> is great. I love how &mdash; when I accidentally hit the keyboard shortcut for the screen that I'm already on &mdash; I get a message saying:</p><pre><code>This IS screen 1 (mutt)</code></pre><p>I'm fairly sure that it also adds "...you muppet." under its breath.</p>
