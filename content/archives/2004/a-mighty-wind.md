I was really disappointed because I had enjoyed Christopher Guest's previous film (Best in Show) enormously. I didn't go to see it at the cinema, but since we subscribed to <a href="http://www.lovefilm.com/" title="Lovefilm.com - a great films by post service">LOVEFiLM</a> we've been catching up on a lot of films that we missed when when they came out. I have to say that the critics were talking utter tosh. A Mighty Wind is a wonderful film. It's true that there aren't quite as many 'laugh out loud' moments as Best in Show, but it's still very funny, acutely observed and unexpectedly touching.</p><p>The film is a mock documentary about a reunion folk concert held in memory of a recently-deceased folk impresario. The details of the costumes, old album covers and album titles are so perfectly judged that you start thinking that they must be real. The semi-improvised dialogue works brilliantly, and there are some fabulous moments when a character comes out with something completely bizarre or outrageous. The part that worked best for me was the tender relationship between Mitch (completely dazed after his recent release from a mental institution) and Mickey (his one-time musical and romantic partner, until they had a huge row). Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara judge their performance perfectly, as Mitch and Mickey tentatively get to know one another again. It's a bonus that the music is actually pretty good, and I even found myself humming Mitch and Mickey's slightly sickly hits for a while after watching the film.</p>
