<p>At last! The public beta of <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> &mdash; the new MacOS X editor is out! I was so excited I had to mention it right away, even if it is barely 7am. It looks extremely promising so far, but I'll write more about it later when I've had a proper chance to play with it.</p>
