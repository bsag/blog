<p>
I've just come across some great resources for learning Perl. I've now worked through <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lperl3/index.html" title="Learning Perl, 3rd edition by Randal L.Â Schwartz and TomÂ Phoenix - The Llama Book">Learning Perl</a> and I'm steeling myself to tackle <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pperl3/index.html" title="Programming Perl, 3rd edition by LarryÂ Wall, TomÂ Christiansen and JonÂ Orwant - The Camel Book">Programming Perl</a>, so I don't think I need another beginners book. However, if you're thinking about learning Perl, the full text of <a href="http://learn.perl.org/library/beginning_perl/" title="Beginning Perl, available on learn.perl.org">Beginning Perl</a> by Simon Cozens is available online for free. It looks like a clear and helpful book that sets out all the basics.
