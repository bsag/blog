<p>I really love this kind of thing, but I can't quite explain why. This <a href="http://www.vcalc.net/cu.htm" title="Everything you could ever want to know about the Curta calculator">mechanical calculator</a> was invented by Curt Herzstark &mdash; an Austrian Jew &mdash; while he was being held in Buchenwald concentration camp during the Second World War. I played with the simulator for ages, but I still can't quite figure out how you would actually use it to calculate things. It's like a <a href="http://www.hpmuseum.org/sliderul.htm" title="The Museum of HP Calculators - explains how they work">slide rule</a>; my Dad used one for years before the advent of affordable electronic calculators, but to me, it's tantamount to magic.</p>

<p>I'd love to have a go on a real Curta calculator though &mdash; it looks as if it has just the right amount of clicking, rattling, twirling things to play with.</p>
