<p>You might have noticed that &mdash; in a fit of Spring zeal &mdash; I've restyled blockquotes (again). While I liked the <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/blog/archives/000317.html" title="Fancy bloquotes">previous style</a> with <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2003/05/21/stylingBlockquotes" title="CSS bloquotes technique">graphical quote marks</a>, it was a bit greedy on space and also didn't scale well. If you have a short quote, the size of the quote graphics is out of proportion to the height of the text, and rather overpowers it.</p>

<p>I think that the new style is distinctive, but a little more subtle. Let me know what you think.</p>
