<p>It's been a fantastic couple of days for great MacOS X software. First, <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox 2.3 </a>was released. The thing that immediately struck me was that the text is rendered much better, so notes are pretty to look at now. It seems like a minor point, but it was something that bugged me slightly before. There are a lot of much less visible changes to the kinds of attributes you can use, and to the actions and agents. I'm looking forward to digging a bit deeper into it in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>Then <a href="http://ranchero.com/2004/09/21.php">Ranchero Software</a> released the public beta of <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/beta.php">NetNewsWire 2</a> and the new weblog editor, <a href="http://ranchero.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>. NetNewsWire has some nice new features like Smart Lists (which work like Smart Playlists in iTunes), flagging of feeds and Search Engine subscriptions (so that you can search a huge number of feeds for entries on a particular topic). It seems to work very smoothly, and also &mdash; as you might expect &mdash; it interacts very well with MarsEdit. You can select an item in NNW and send it to MarsEdit, which opens a post with all the relevant URLs filled in. You can also set up a template so that entries generated in this way have a particular format. Both applications have gorgeous new icons designed by Bryan Bell and Jon Hicks &mdash; the MarsEdit one is <strong>really</strong> cute, with a chubby little rocket orbiting a shiny Mars.</p>

<p>All I need now is for Macromates to release <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>, and I'd be a really happy little geek.</p>
