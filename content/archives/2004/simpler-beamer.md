<p>Peter Smith emailed me to tell me that he has written a simpler, getting-started guide to using beamer.cls &mdash; the LaTeX presentation programme I have <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/2004/06/13/latex-beamer/" title="LaTeX beamer">raved about</a> here. <a href="http://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/teaching_staff/Smith/LaTeX/guides/SimpleBeamer.pdf" title="Link to download the guide">Peter's guide</a> is really excellent, and much less intimidating than the huge (though very informative) manual that comes with <a href="http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net/" title="The home of beamer">beamer</a>. If you've been meaning to play with beamer, but didn't quite know where to start, give the Simple Beamer guide a read.</p><p>It also contains a fantastic quote attributed to the philosopher Stephanie Lewis, and apparently stage-whispered during someone else's presentation:</p><blockquote><p>Power corrupts: PowerPoint corrupts absolutely.</p></blockquote><p>Peter advocates making transparencies with beamer rather than showing the presentation with a data projector. I do sympathise with his reasons (the most compelling of which is that you can waste oodles of time tinkering with colour schemes and so on), but I now always make projected presentations rather than transparencies for three main reasons:</p><ol><li>Transparencies are actually quite expensive, and become even more costly when you manage to make a hash of printing them, or find a typo.</li><li>I'm always altering my presentation right up until the last moment. Often, those last-minute edits improve it greatly. Yes, I should probably be more organised, but sometimes you need the adrenaline rush to think about what you really want to say.</li><li>I almost always show at least one movie in my lectures and presentations. Movies don't work well unless you flip the transparencies <strong>really</strong> fast.</li></ol>
