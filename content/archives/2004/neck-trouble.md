<p>I don't know <em>what</em> I was doing in my sleep last night, but I woke up this morning with a really painful neck. I think I might have trapped a nerve. I've been walking around all day very gingerly &mdash; as if I'm wearing an invisible neck brace. Some kinds of relatively minor injuries seem to cause disproportionate amounts of pain and inconvenience, and you can't do very much at all without moving your neck. Somebody feed me painkillers.</p>
