<p><a href="http://www.idlewords.com/about.htm" title="About Maciej Ceglowski">Maciej</a> is a wonderful writer, and never more so than when he <a href="http://www.idlewords.com/2004/06/lille.htm" title="Lille">writes about his travels</a>. I'm a complete sucker for writing about Britain by non-residents, and this passage had me rolling around with recognition:</p><blockquote><p>Great Britain is a deceptively small country; it's very easy to get distracted and find that you've overshot it altogether, which is how I found myself standing near a petrochemical plant in Calais just a few hours after boarding a train in Sheffield, a city that I thought was safely removed from the southern coast.</p></blockquote><p>Given the state of our railway system, I'm quite impressed that he managed to get <strong>out</strong> of Sheffield on a train, let alone make it to Dover to catch a ferry. There's probably some kind of award available on receipt of proof of such a feat of derring-do. I gather that <a href="http://www.visitbritain.com/" title="UK Tourism Industry Site">Visit Britain</a> have had a concerted campaign to encourage more tourists, so apropos of Maciej's comment, how about this as a marketing slogan: "Britain &mdash; blink and you'll miss it."</p>
