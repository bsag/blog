<p>One of the few things I really miss from Oxford (apart from my friends and the lovely buildings) is the availability of great independent cinemas. <a href="http://www.picturehouses.co.uk/site/cinemas/Oxford/local.htm" title="The Phoenix, Oxford">The Phoenix</a> and the <a href="http://www.ultimatepicturepalace.co.uk/" title="The Ulitmate Picture Palace">UPP</a> screened a wonderful range of independent and foreign films; around here there only seems to be the usual glut of Odeons and UCIs showing the standard releases. So Mr. Bsag and I are thinking about subscribing to one of the DVD-rental-by-post services. I think we've got it narrowed down to either the Guardian's <a href="http://guardian.movietrak.co.uk/monthlysubscription.asp" title="Movietrak">Movietrak</a> service or <a href="https://www.lovefilm.com/howitworks.php?SID=47224e31913db0857875bc22d95a35f0">LOVEFiLM.com</a>. My problem is that I can't check out the range available from LOVEFiLM; they say that they have almost every DVD released in the UK, but do I believe them? And do they have a decent range of independent and foreign films? If anyone has had experience of either of these services (or any other good ones I might have missed, provided that they deliver in the UK), I would love to know how you find them.</p>
