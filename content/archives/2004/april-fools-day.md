<p>I've had two shocks today:</p>

<ol>
<li>I had a nasty moment when I thought that <a href="http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/" title="Brian Eno">Brian Eno's</a> prodigious talent might have <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/reports/arts/archers%3C/em%3E20040401.shtml" title="Brian Eno remixes Archer's theme tune">completely evaporated</a> overnight &mdash; just like that.</li>
<li>When I checked my email on <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/mailsmith/index.shtml" title="Bare Bones Software - Mailsmith">Mailsmith</a> this morning, I heard a loud buzzing alongside the normal notification sound. I thought that one of the drivers must have come adrift in the speakers, but I eventually checked my notification preferences. If you use Mailsmith, take a look at the notification preferences today (I'm not giving anything away :-)). Any company that takes the trouble to build an April Fool's joke into their software (well ahead of time) is alright by me.</li>
</ol>
