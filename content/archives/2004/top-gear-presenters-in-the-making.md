<p>I overheard this exchange at the bus stop this morning, delivered by three boys commenting on every car that went past:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Boy 1, in a pre-pubescent Brummie squeak]: Whoa! That's a Subaru!</p>
<p>[Boy 2]: Like the one in "2 Fast 2 Furious"!</p>
<p>[Boy 3]: Yeeahh!</p>
<p>[All watch in awed silence &mdash; crowded on the curb for a better view &mdash; as the car goes by]</p>
<p>[Boy 1]: Crap spoiler<sup>1</sup>, though.</p>
<p>[Boy 3]: It's the worst spoiler in the world!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone is a critic. Bless 'em.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> By which they meant the aerodynamic spoiler on the car, not a spoiler of the film variety.</p>
