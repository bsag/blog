I was very sceptical that I was going to like it as much as Seven Swans &mdash; which I love with a passion &mdash; but I was curious to see what it was like.</p>

<p>I've now listened to the album about three times in less than 24 hours, and I'm completely captivated. It has all the delicacy of his next album, but also a sense of loss, alienation and the slow decline of a once-great State. I'm sure that I've just made it sound depressing, but it's anything but that. Even in the most quietly despairing songs, there's a tiny hope that things might get better, and also that there are people around who care. From 'For The Windows in Paradise, For the Fatherless in Ypsilani':</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was dressed in embarrassment
I was dressed in wine.
If you had a part of me, will you take your time?
Even if I come back, even if I die
Is there some idea to replace my life?
Like a father to impress;
Like a mother's mourning dress
If you ever make a mess, I'll do anything for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sufjan has a kind of quiet rhetorical fire, even though that seems like a contradiction. Actually, I think he <em>is</em> a contradiction. Many of the titles &mdash; such as 'Oh Detroit, Lift Up Your Weary Head (Restore! Rebuild! Reconsider!)' &mdash; read like the exhortations of a 1950s union leader, or one of the earnest, burning people who rage against the dying of the light at Speaker's Corner in the rain.</p>

<p>I would find it almost impossible to single out a few tracks for special mention &mdash; they are all so strong. 'The Upper Peninsula' features a wonderful Hammond organ going on in the background and lyrics about the poor of America ("I live in America/with a pair of Payless shoes". 'They Also Mourn Who Do Not Wear Black' has a really odd time-signature, which reminds me a little of some of the work of <a href="http://www.mfiles.co.uk/Composers/Lalo-Schifrin.htm">Lalo Schifrin</a>. It does amazing and beneficial things to my neurons, simultaneously lulling me and waking me up.</p>

<p>It's a really superb album, and I highly recommend it, whether you have heard any of his work before or not.</p>
