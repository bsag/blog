<p>We're back from a few days spent with our respective families. I would have posted about something trivial or geeky (or both), as I usually do, but after the tsunami that would feel incredibly fatuous. All I will say is that I've never felt so lucky to be safe, warm and surrounded by my family. This evening, I'll be thinking about the hundreds of thousands of people who have had their loved ones, homes and communities swept away from them.</p>
