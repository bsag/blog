<p>One of the joys of listening to an iPod on random play is that you occasionally hear a track so surprising that you would be prepared to swear <em>in a court of law</em> had absolutely nothing to do with you, because you have no recollection of putting it on the iPod, and you can't think why you would have done anyway.</p>
<p>As an example, I was happily listening to my iPod this morning, when the intro to a new track began:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[iPod] DUM-da-dum, DUM-da-dum...</p>
<p>[Me, because I already recognise the song] What the?</p>
<p>[iPod] DUM-da-dum, DUM-da-dum, It's not unusual to be loved by anyone, DA-da-da-da-da, It's not unusual to have fun with anyone...</p>
<p>[Me] Tom Jones! I swear that I'm not responsible for putting that on, officer &mdash; someone must have sneakily synchronised it over while I wasn't looking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll tell you what though &mdash; nothing gets the hips a-swinging first thing in the morning like a good dose of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/tomjones/index.shtml/" title="BBC Wales profile of Tom Jones">Jones the Voice</a>. It did me the world of good. You see, my iPod knows me better than I do. There's lovely.</p>
