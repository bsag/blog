<p>This <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/larimdame/1436655/" title="Tunnel of Light">photo</a> reminded me of something I meant to write about when I got back from <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/2004/07/23/and-im-back/">Germany</a>, but forgot about. Frankfurt airport has an amazing link corridor through which those moving walkways run to speed you between gates. It's painted white and generally dimly lit, but a series of lights paint the walls with a shifting set of colours, producing an effect a little like the <em>Aurora Borealis</em>. At the same time, there's a sound track of bird song, running water and gentle bells, which is quite soothing. However, they they didn't stop there, and there's also a subtle but perceptible smell of mint or citrus (or perhaps both), which has a refreshing effect. I found it quite a nice &mdash; if slightly odd &mdash; experience after being cooped up on a plane for several hours, although the whole thing made me feel as if I'd unwittingly ended up on that space station in the film 2001. It had the same self-consciously futuristic feel.</p>
