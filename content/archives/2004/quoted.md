<p>A reader<sup>1</sup> emailed me to point out that part of my <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/2004/11/20/macexpo/">rambling entry about MacExpo</a> (embarrassingly, the most rambling part) had been quoted in the 'Voices from the Web' column in the latest issue of MacUser. I subscribe to the magazine, but I'd been busy, and hadn't had a chance to open the issue &mdash; it was quite a surprise.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> I feel an irresistible urge to add "...a Mrs. Trellis from North Wales" at this point, but that would baffle people who don't listen to <a href="http://www.isihac.co.uk/">I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue</a>.</p>
