I love Caribbean accents. The other day, on the bus, I was eavesdropping on a conversation between a Jamaican couple. I do try not to earwig in on other people's conversations if I can help it, but I find the Jamaican accent so mellifluous that I couldn't help myself.

I think that they were talking about doing the laundry and related problems. At any rate, at one point, the guy said,
</p><blockquote>
"De water <strong>shrink</strong> 'im."

while referring to his jumper.
