<p>There's a nice round up of the available keyboard-driven launchers over at <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2004/04/09/launchers.html?page=1" title="Launchers for Mac OS X">MacDevCenter</a>. The author has some very complimentary things to say about <a href="http://blacktree.com/apps/quicksilver/" title="Quicksilver">Quicksilver</a>, despite being a self-confessed <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/" title="Obdev.at - Launchbar">LaunchBar</a> addict. It's worth a read if you're thinking about using a launcher of some kind.</p>

<p>I &mdash; of course &mdash; am <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/2004/03/29/an-announcement/" title="An announcement">not at all impartial</a> on the matter either :-)</p>
