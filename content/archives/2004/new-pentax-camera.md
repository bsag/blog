<p>I was reading the latest <a href="http://macuser.pcpro.co.uk/" title="MacUser magazine">MacUser magazine</a> over breakfast this morning, and my attention was caught by a review for a new Pentax digital SLR. It's a lovely looking camera, and was given a rave review in <a href="http://www.pentax.co.uk/pdf/DCAM13%20ist%20D%20A.pdf" title="It scored 94 percent!">Digital Camera Magazine</a>, but the thing that struck me first was the name. It's called the *ist D. Yes, that is an asterisk.</p>

<p>I was so convinced that '*ist D' was the catastrophic outcome of some freak spell checker accident that I checked <a href="http://www.pentax.co.uk/" title="Pentax UK">Pentax's own site</a>, but it turned out to be the real name. What marketing department was responsible for  that one, I wonder? I have this idea that they put the asterisk in as some kind of glob place holder for the first part of the name: "photoist, pictureist, digist, camist? Oh, forget it, let's go to the pub. Leave it as *ist, no-one will care. *ist D. For digital. Sorted."</p>

<p>What I'd like to know (and what isn't even discussed in any of the reviews I've seen) is how the blithering heck you're supposed to pronounce it.</p>
