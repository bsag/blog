<p>Airports can be interesting places for short periods of time. You cross paths with all sorts of fascinating people. While I was waiting in the check-in queue, I overheard a father explaining &mdash; in great detail &mdash; the entire plot of Part 2 of Wagner's Ring Cycle, <a href="http://www.rwagner.net/contrib/lb/e-rheingold.html" title="A slightly shorter explanation of the plot">Das Rheingold</a> to his early-teenaged son. The boy seemed to be listening fairly attentively to tales of Rhinedaughters and the symbolism of the Ring, which probably made him a bit unusual amongst the ranks of teenagers.</p><p>They passed through the check-in desk and disappeared, and I went on my way too. About half an hour later, I saw them again in the Departure Lounge. Dad was still only at the beginning of Scene 2, and Son gave me a slightly glazed and desperate expression. I hope they weren't on a long flight.</p>
