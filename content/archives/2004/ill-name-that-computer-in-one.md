<p>Mr. Bsag generally has a rather troubled and tempestuous relationship with computers &mdash; he doesn't get on well with them, and they don't like him much in return. However, he does like spotting guest appearances by Macintoshes on TV programmes and films (it's amazing what several years of intensive brain-washing by a spouse can do). We were watching something on TV, and he thought he spotted one:</p>

<p><strong>Him</strong>: "Look! It's an iBook!"</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: "It's a white fabric place mat, you loon!"</p>

<p>The iMat: It will be the next big thing, you mark my words.</p>
