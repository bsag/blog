<p>The comments feed seems to be behaving a little erratically, and is only updating intermittently. I'll look into it and see if there's a way to fix it. Anyway, the main posts feed seems to be working fine. I meant to point out yesterday that there are also feeds for the comments on individual posts, if you are following a particular discussion. The link is just above the comments form on the individual entry page.</p>
