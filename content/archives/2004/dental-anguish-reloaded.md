<p>It's finally over! I've had my wisdom tooth out, and as with many things that you dread beforehand, it wasn't as bad as I had feared. There was a huge amount of pressure and really nasty grinding noises, but the tooth came out without too much of a struggle.</p>

<p>I feel a bit worn out now, and my mouth feels sore and bruised, but I'm really glad that it's out. My dentist even gave me it the tooth in a little tooth fairy envelope. I think if I put it under my pillow tonight, I'm likely to find that the tooth fairy has left me a tooth exactly like the one I put under the pillow.</p>
