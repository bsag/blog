<p class="img-shadow"><img src="/mt-static/blog/archives/images/stgeorge.jpg" alt="St. George" width="160" height="120" border="0" /></p><p>After days of rain, it's really nice to see the sun and some blue sky. It makes the stone look really warm and golden. After what must be years of walking past this Chapel, I noticed St. George slaying the dragon on top of it. It's amazing what a bit of sun can do.</p>
