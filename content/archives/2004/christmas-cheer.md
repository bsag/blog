<p>I've just got back from the annual 'Black Country Beer Bash' that some friends run every year. We all meet up at a nice pub in the Black Country and drink lots of real ale and eat mountains of food. Mr. Bsag and I haven't made it for a couple of years because of the inconvenience of distance, so we hadn't been to this particular pub before.</p>

<p>The Olde White Rose has more real ale pump handles than I've ever seen outside a beer festival &mdash; it's wonderful. The hardier souls cycled up the the Black Country, while those of us who are wimps or have no balance on our recumbent bicycles after a couple of shandies took public transport.</p>

<p>I decided to stick to Belgian beers, as they had quite a good selection, and ended up with a <a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/rate_results/1534/5423/">Gouden Carolus Tripel</a>. It wasn't until after I ordered it that I discovered it was 9% ABV. Phew. Strength notwithstanding, it was a lovely drink, with an orangey, spicy taste, and a note of violets somewhere around. It's worth seeking out if you have any Belgian beer outlets near you, but just don't drink too many or even public transport will become a challenge.</p>
