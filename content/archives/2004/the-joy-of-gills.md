<p>In this age of huge out-of-town superstores, it's comforting that you can still find an old-fashioned hardware shop when you need one. Gill and Co.<sup>1</sup> &mdash; tucked away down a very narrow alleyway in Oxford &mdash; is just such a shop. You can go in and ask for a single two inch nail, and know that they will happily sell you one and solemnly wrap it up for you.</p><p>We managed to break the plastic doohickeys that fix the toilet seat to the pan, which resulted in an unpleasantly insecure seat. Call me fussy, but I like my toilet seats firmly anchored. I had no idea what those plastic things are officially called, but a brief explanation and and a lot of hand-waving in Gills and they said, "Certainly. Would you like black or white toilet lid fixings?" All is well again in the Bsag bathroom.</p><p><sup>1</sup> As featured in Inspector Morse, where &mdash; if I remember rightly &mdash; one of Oxford's many murderers worked. The real employees are lovely, though.</p>
