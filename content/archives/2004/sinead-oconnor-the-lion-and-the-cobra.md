<p class="img-shadow"><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003JAW/butshesagirl-21" title="Buy this album at amazon.co.uk"><img src="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/blog/archives/images/B000003JAW.02.TZZZZZZZ.jpg" height="65" width="65" alt="Buy this album at amazon.co.uk" /></a></p><p>I usually recommend albums when I like almost all of the tracks on the album, but this is a bit different. Don't get me wrong &mdash; I don't <strong>dislike</strong> any of the tracks (I find Sinead's voice so extraordinary that she could make a nursery rhyme interesting). 'Mandinka', 'Jerusalem' and 'Just Like U Said It Would B' are all great tracks, though the heavy 80s synth sounds are a bit dated in places. But I love this album for one track &mdash; 'Troy'.</p>

<p>The first time I heard 'Troy' my skin nearly crawled off my body, I was getting so many goose-pimples. Even though I've heard it many times, I'm still not entirely clear what the song is actually about (there seems to be some kind of infidelity going on, and then a tragic event), but the theme is clear enough. It's about survival--coming through something very difficult and rising stronger than before. These lines from the song haunt me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll die
But I will rise
And I will return
The phoenix from the flame
I have learned
I will rise
And you'll see me return
Being what I am
There is no other Troy
For me to burn</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This song uses her range to its full potential. Very few singers have such a mutable voice, and she can shift from a sweet whisper to a howling roar in a second. The lines, "I have learned/I will rise" are almost whispered, then there's silence and "The phoenix from the flame" are shouted out with such strength and triumphalism that you can't help but feel uplifted.</p>
<p>This album is 17 years old now, but the song came back to me this week watching <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/touching-the-void" title="Touching the Void">Touching the Void</a>, and thinking about endurance, survival and life. The song obviously touches on these themes, but there's another link for me. I mentioned in my entry on Touching the Void that it reminded me of a documentary I saw about flamingos. The latin name for the flamingo is <em>Phoenicopterus ruber</em> (there are several sub-species), and <em>Phoenicopterus</em> roughly means 'phoenix-winged' (I think--my Latin and Greek are a bit rusty). I believe that they were named both for their flame-like colour, but also because they can exist in scorching, hostile conditions that would kill any other animal. In a weird kind of word association, I think of flamingos when I hear 'Troy', and now also mountaineering.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this has the be the worst-recorded album of great music that I've ever heard, so my music-loving and audiophile selves have a bit of a battle over it. The music-lover usually wins, but the recording engineers should hang their heads in shame over this dog's dinner. I know that Sinead's enormous dynamic range must have made finding the right level a bit of a challenge, but even so, they should have been able to do a better job with it.</p>
