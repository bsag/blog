<p>There's a great article in Thursday's <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk" title="The Guardian Online">Guardian</a> in Ben Goldacre's <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/badscience/story/0,12980,1171158,00.html" title="Bad Science - Antibodies need some pollen, sometimes">Bad Science</a> column about the kind of pseudo-scientific jargon you see on beauty products. I quote:</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>Our noble bad science spotter Carl Brancher sends important news of
 PO2 Contour Cream from Laboratoires Herzog: it's a "patented
 stabilisation of oxygen within a cream" that "puts oxygen back into
 the skin, reoxygenates skin cells, encourages natural rejuvenation".
 It sounds like bollocks; but it smells like peroxide. Especially
 since Laboratoires Herzog point out, in the small print, that you
 will want to keep the stuff off your eyebrows. Now, I'm not sure that
 this is going to put any useful oxygen in my skin, because I've got a
 perfectly adequate circulatory system to handle that; but more
 importantly, I'm not sure that peroxide is quite what I'm looking for
 on my face. For &pound;25. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To which I can only say &mdash; well said, that man. I'm always yelling at the screen when the latest face cream is advertised as having 'advanced activated liposomes' or some such thing. It's just a fancy word for fat &mdash; you could get more or less the same effect by rubbing your face with cooking oil. Pah.</p>
