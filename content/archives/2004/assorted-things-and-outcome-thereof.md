<p>So, we're back after our short trip away to sort a lot of things out. The work thing fell through at the very last minute. And when I say 'fell through' what I really mean is 'crashed to the ground and smashed into millions of tiny pieces'. I don't want to go into too much detail (for one thing, I'm still fuming about it), but it will probably take quite a bit longer than I had hoped to get my research up and running. It will all come out in the wash (as my mum always says).</p>

<p>The house thing was also very nearly a bust too. We made appointments to see three houses to rent on Tuesday, and by Wednesday, one &mdash; the most promising of course &mdash; had already been let. The others weren't particularly wonderful either. Hopefully, our vegetarian bacon-style soya bits have been saved at the last minute by a friend who is moving out of his house to live with his girlfriend. He was going to let the house out anyway, so I think we'll be able to come to an arrangement. It's not in the best position for me to commute, but it isn't impossible. The house itself is nice, and our friend is putting in a new bathroom<sup>1</sup>, re-painting and re-carpeting throughout. This will probably mean that we will be knee-deep in dust-sheets for a while, but it will be lovely when it's done.</p><p>All in all, we seem to be making slow progress, but I'm dreading the process of packing everything up. I'm going to a conference for nearly a week just before we're due to move, so poor Mr. Bsag is going to have to do a lot of the preparatory work himself.</p><p><sup>1</sup> The bathroom suite is a stunning example of the decade that taste forgot &mdash; the bath, basin and toilet are all a bright toothpaste green. Lovely.</p>
