<p>I went to fetch Mr. Bsag from our old flat on Saturday, where he has been finishing off some work. So now everything is cleared out of our old place, and our new house really feels like a home. Great though the new house is, I knew that something was missing &mdash; my husband! We cooked a great meal tonight (listening to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/proms2004/pip/ytt24/" title="Proms Schedule">Bach's Mass in B minor on Radio 3</a>), then sat there looking at all the space we have and grinning like cats who have got the cream. To continue the cat analogy, we seem to have landed on our feet at long last.</p>
