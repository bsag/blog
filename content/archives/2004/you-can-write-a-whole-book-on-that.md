<p>While I was in <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/blog/archives/000630.html" title="Cult of celebrity">Borders</a> <sup>1</sup>, I spotted the following title, which amused me no end: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1565924177/ref=sr_aps_books_1_1/026-6543311-9982829" title="Buy this book on Amazon.co.uk">Windows 98 Annoyances</a>. Priceless. Disappointingly, the description on Amazon suggests that it's about hacking Windows 98, rather than just listing the bugs.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> I should say that I don't usually buy books in Borders, because I prefer to patronise the <a href="http://www.phill.co.uk/comedy/league/" title="A local shop for local people">local</a> shop <a href="http://www.blackwells.co.uk/bobuk/scripts/welcome.jsp" title="Blackwells Online Bookshop">Blackwells</a>, but they didn't have what I was looking for. Nor did Borders as it turned out.</p>
