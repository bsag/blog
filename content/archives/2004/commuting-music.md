<p>If you happen to have a fairly long and dull walk to the train station in the morning, can I recommend a track that will put a groove in your step? 'Zig Zag Wanderer' by Captain Beefheart and His Magic Band (from the album <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00002DF8F/qid=1092259780/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_11_1/202-5931643-9883865" title="Buy Safe As Milk at Amazon">Safe As Milk</a>) is just such a track. The funky bass riff in the middle will make you play air-bass and will undoubtedly get you some funny looks from other Beefheartless commuters, but it's worth it for the smile that will be on your face for a few hours.</p>
