<p>As we've all heard, <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/store/" title="iTunes Music Store">iTunes Music Store</a> is now available in Britain, France and Germany. I <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/apple-music-stuff/" title="Apple Music stuff">ranted a bit</a> about how unfair the whole thing was a year ago, but now I'm beginning to see the wisdom of that old saying, "Be careful what you wish for &mdash; it might come true." Crikey. It's like crack. The really lethal thing is the low price per track. You think, "Well, I'll just get this track &mdash; it's only 79p<sup>1</sup>, after all." But all those 79 pences soon add up.</p><p>My first purchase was a nostalgic one. I've got a load of really worn out cassettes of <a href="http://www.askmeaskmeaskme.com/" title="The Smiths fan site">The Smiths</a> from the late 80's which I can't play any more as I don't have a tape player. So I got one of the three Smiths tracks available, <a href="http://www.askmeaskmeaskme.com/lyrics/thesmiths/whatdifference.htm" title="Lyrics of 'What Difference Does It Make?'">What Difference Does It Make?</a>, from the first album. I put the headphones on, turned up the volume, and from the first jangly, bouncy bars of Johnny Marr's thrilling guitar riffs, I travelled back in time. I was back in a youth center hall in the early 1980's, whirling around with my first proper boyfriend, <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/that-charming-man/" title="That charming man">arms windmilling crazily</a> and drunk on the joy and freedom of it. That's not bad for 79p.</p><p>Seriously though, I don't think iTMS will replace buying CDs for me. The quality isn't quite up to listening on a proper hifi, and &mdash; at least at the moment &mdash; they don't feature the kind of artists I tend to like.</p><p><sup>1</sup> I won't go on about the fact that 79p is eqivalent to $1.44 at today's exchange rates &mdash; significantly more than 99Â¢ &mdash; we Europeans always end up paying through the nose.</p>
