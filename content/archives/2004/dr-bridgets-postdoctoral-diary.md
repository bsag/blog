<p>We had much amusement in the office today over a brilliant 'Bridget Jones' pastiche by <a href="http://intl-nextwave.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2003/07/01/6" title="Dr. Bridget's Postdoctoral Diary on Nextwave">Kat Arney</a>. I was supposed to be job-hunting on <a href="http://intl-nextwave.sciencemag.org/" title="The place to go for science jobs">Nextwave</a>, and looking for tips to make myself utterly irresistible to potential employers. Instead, I spent the next 20 minutes laughing my head off, and then forced my Postgrads to stop work too while I impressed on them how hilarious it was.</p>

<p>This passage in particular struck a chord:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Search the Internet for exciting conferences in exotic locations. Very enthusiastic about the prospect of a meeting in Honolulu when I remember that I have (a) no travel money left and (b) no results. My boss points out that I went to a very interesting conference last year in Dorset. Argue back that the windswept vistas of the South Coast are no match for the sun-kissed beaches of Hawaii. She retorts that I should be interested only in the quality of the science and anyway, the funding body thinks that &pound;46 for a return train fare is more than enough to spend on me.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Number of tasks on to-do list as of Monday morning: 36
Number of tasks on to-do list as of Friday evening: 27
Distance by which frontiers of science have been pushed back this week: 0.73 mm
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It might only be funny if you're a scientist, but there's probably something that most people can identify with.</p>
