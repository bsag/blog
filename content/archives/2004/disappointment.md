<p>Bugger. Last week, we went to look at some properties to rent in the area we'll be moving to. One house was OK, but nothing really endeared us to it, one was appalling (and on a very run-down council estate, complete with boarded-up houses and burnt-out cars), but the last one &mdash; with apologies to Goldilocks &mdash; was absolutely perfect.</p><p>We told the estate agents that we were very interested in the place, and wanted to arrange a moving date toward the end of July. After a lot of phone calls, we've just heard that the landlords have decided to take it off the books and let it privately. Back to square one...</p>
