<p>When I ordered my 12" PowerBook, I decided that I might as well max out the RAM<sup>1</sup>, but I had to wait because the extra 1 GB stick was back-ordered. I got it today, and I'm revelling in the most RAM I've ever had installed on a computer. The laptop felt pretty fast before, but now it's <em>really</em> snappy. I do have a legitimate reason for needing all this computing grunt &mdash; I'm going to be using digital video pretty extensively in my work, and I know from experience that applications like Final Cut Pro need as much RAM as you can throw at them. That's my story and I'm sticking to it...</p><p><sup>1</sup> You should probably mentally append, "...because I wasn't paying for it." to that sentence.</p>
