<p>Like many people, I've been deluged by virus-laden and bounced emails (with my address spoofed as the sender) as a result of the <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/01/28/1075088091365.html" title="Report on MyDoom in The Age">MyDoom</a> virus. I've also had the usual quantity of spam, through which I have to dredge to find my genuine email. But among the usual crop of âhot chicks/viagra/Atkins diet' tempting offers, one spam stood out &mdash; metallic yarn on special offer.</p>

<p>And my metallic yarn needs have gone unfulfilled for so long.</p>
