<p>The comedy and drama available on Radio 4 is often much better than the offerings on TV. A few weeks ago, they had a dramatisation of Mike Daisey's <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/074323815X/butshesagirl-21" title="Buy the book at Amazon.co.uk - for some reason, the British version of the paperback has a different sub-title">21 Dog Years: Doing Time @ Amazon.com</a>, read by the author himself. I've just got around to listening to the recording we made of it, and I haven't laughed so much in ages. Daisey is a fantastic story-teller, and reminded me a little of Laurie Anderson in the way that he used a kind of sing-song voice and dramatic pauses and elongations of words. Daisey moves from corporate worship to complete bafflement in a year, and argues that dot.coms work on a peculiarly compressed timescale &mdash; hence the title. When he leaves the company (at the height of the dot.com boom) he plaintively admits to a head-hunter that he only knows how to play Tetris. The recruiter's insistent riposte &mdash; "But you worked at <strong>Amazon.com</strong>..." &mdash; tells you everything you need to know about that particular period. His tales of life in a cubicle rival those of <a href="http://www.dilbert.com/" title="Dilbert comics">Dilbert</a>, and his method of reducing his average 'call resolution time' was worthy of <a href="http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/the_characters/html/character2.html" title="Wally and other characters">Wally</a> himself; he simply hung up on every third or fourth caller after five seconds.</p><p>Unfortunately, the play doesn't seem to be available on Listen Again now, but the book is probably worth a read.</p>
