<p>I've never been particularly interested in local newspapers, but since I'm in a new area now, I thought I would glance at the local free-sheet that popped through the door. Little did I suspect that I was living in an area where thrilling and mysterious events occur. It seems that the local park (which is actually quite a large Country Park, rather than the typical bandstands and flowerbeds type of thing) is inhabited by a wild man. This man is referred to as 'Barkfoot' &mdash; a hilarious<sup>1</sup> play on 'Bigfoot', but it also refers to his home-made bark footwear and bark cowboy hat. He apparently also wears a long coat woven out of reeds and grasses, and adores sausages &mdash; all of the encounters people have had with him have involved sausage-related incidents of one kind or another.</p>

<p>There were quite a few column inches devoted to Barkfoot, including a couple of letters from people who had experienced a Barkfoot close encounter. One even had a bit of a chat with him, and found out that his 'real' name is Larry Larch (or Larchey) and &mdash; this is the surreal bit &mdash; he used to be a bottle-opener designer in Hemel Hempstead. I think that my favourite bit was a quote from a Park official who said:</p><blockquote><p>"Even though there is someone allegedly wearing bark shoes, it does not mean he or they are living in the Park."</p></blockquote><p>Barkfoot (or Larchey) reminds me of the <a href="http://website.lineone.net/~dominicow/green_man_folklore.htm" title="The Legend of the Green Man">Green Man</a>; a rather mysterious folkloric figure who is associated with the Arthurian legends, and also represents the rebirth of life in Spring and Summer. I think that every park should have its own Green Man, so long may Barkfoot continue to enjoy his sausages in the copses.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <del>Well, it is a local paper.</del> (Retracted &mdash; see comments.)</p>
