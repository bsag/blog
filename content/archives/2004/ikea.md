<p>Since <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/assorted-things-and-outcome-thereof/" title="Assorted things and the outcome thereof">our plans</a> had to be radically restructured, we decided that we would make an <em>en route</em> visit to <a href="http://www.ikea.com" title="Ikea">Ikea</a>. We weren't intending to buy anything<sup>1</sup>; it was more of a reconnaissance mission to check out the lie of the land and sit on some sofas. Our current flat is fully furnished, and while we have a few pieces of furniture that we have somehow managed to shoe-horn in amongst the truly horrible pieces that came with the flat, we'll need some more after we move if we're going to avoid sitting and sleeping on the floor.</p>

<p>You'll have to bear with me here, as I'm sure that everyone reading is a seasoned Ikea professional &mdash; "been there, done that, bought a million tea lights for Â£1.50". But I've only been once, several years ago, and Mr. Bsag was an Ikea virgin. We must have looked like slack-jawed yokels wandering around the shelves, uttering awed statements about the cheapness and beauty of everything on display; "Look! That rug is only &pound;7.50! Here's a little bamboo plant for two quid!". The fact that we have no need of any more rugs &mdash; or indeed any bamboo at all &mdash; is neither here nor there. It really is a bewildering place.</p><p>If you have been to Ikea before, I'm sure you'll be impressed that we <strong>did</strong> manage to come away without making a single purchase. In fact, we were up by two little Ikea pencils, which we forgot to replace in the holder. I don't feel too guilty, though. By the time we've bought some furniture for the new place I'm sure that we will have paid for our pencils many times over.</p><p><sup>1</sup> I imagine this is a common plaintive cry when people find themselves back at their car in a dazed state, and are surprised to find bags full of CD shelves and place mats in their hands.</p>
