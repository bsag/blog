<p>WordPress 1.2 final release is <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/archives/2004/05/22/heres-the-beef/" title="WordPress DevBlog">out</a>, and I've installed it without problems. While I was at it, I also installed the updated <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/10/5399" title="WordPress Support forum - Hacks">statistics plugin</a>, written originally by <a href="http://www.lesterchan.net/blogs/">GamerZ</a> and ported to plugin format by <a href="http://www.frankentosh.com/b2/">Ryan</a>. You can get a whole page of interesting statistics <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/stats/" title="Stats page">here</a>, or use the link right at the bottom of the sidebar on the right. Among other fascinating facts, you can see who tops the league of frequent commenters (like the League of Gentlemen, only... not.). It all seems to be working fine, but let me know if you spot anything amiss.</p>
