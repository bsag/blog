<p>Several weeks ago, the <em>Plecostomus</em> fish in our tank at work died (it seems to be a <a href="http://fuddland.org.uk/archives/2004/04/02/bye_bye_bob.php" title="Bob the upside-down fish shuffles off his mortal coil">difficult time</a> for fish), and the tank has been getting progressively more obscured by algae growing on the glass. <a href="http://www.thetropicaltank.co.uk/Fishindx/compleco.htm" title="Pictures of the Common Plec">Plecostomuses</a> (or perhaps Plecostomi?) feed on algae by scraping it off with their sucker-like mouths, and are ruthlessly efficient at keeping the tank clean. <a href="http://fuddland.org.uk/archives/2004/02/21/blub.php" title="eorge the pleco suckering">David</a> has a nice picture of his pleco, George, doing just that <a href="http://fuddland.org.uk/" title="fuddland">here</a>.</p>

<p>When I came in this morning, I was surprised to see a huge (well, 15 cm long) new pleco in the tank, busily suckering its way around the glass. It's a mesmerising sight from the other side, watching the mouthparts working away at a frantic pace. I once had to catch our former pleco when we had to drain the tank temporarily. I don't recommend it as an experience; it suckered itself on to my palm and started rasping away, making me go "Yeurghh!". It didn't hurt, exactly, but it was a mildly unpleasant surprise.</p>

<p>Now we have to think of a name for New Pleco.</p>
