<p>There's a school playing field out the back of our flat, and earlier today, we were watching a pair of carrion crows pecking and pulling at something flat. It looked a bit like a deflated football. This was &mdash; perhaps &mdash; wishful thinking on our part, as a gang of mini-thugs regularly trespass on the field outside school hours, and continually whack their football against our fence, breaking the fence and annoying the hell out of us. It seemed a bit odd for crows to be bothering with a football though, so we got our binoculars out and took a closer look. We then wished we hadn't; the object was a long-dead and very flat squirrel. Even the crows seemed to be a bit dubious about whether it contained any nutritive value.</p>
