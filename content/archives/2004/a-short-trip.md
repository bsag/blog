<p>I'm off tomorrow to <em>La Continent</em> for a conference &mdash; great timing, just as we're about to move, but it has been planned for a while. So unless I find an internet connection somewhere, things will be quiet around here until next Thursday or Friday. Have fun while I'm away, but no parties in the house, OK?</p>
