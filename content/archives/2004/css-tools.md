<p>If I'd had this <a href="http://www.codepoetry.net/archives/2004/02/07/css_debugger_redux.php" title="codepoetry">CSS debugging bookmarklet</a> when I was designing this site, I might have ended up with a few less bruises after banging my head on the table in frustration. It outlines each <code>div</code> and labels it with a colour and a label to indicate its <code>class</code> or <code>id</code>. It's really handy, and would also be a useful learning tool when examining other people's sites &mdash; in conjunction with the source &mdash; to see how they achieve their look.</p>
