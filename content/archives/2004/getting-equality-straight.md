<p>I must suffer from some rare and highly specific form of dyslexia. Even though I know exactly what the difference is, I keep using <code>=</code> when I mean <code>==</code>. I reckon that about 80% of the problems I've had while writing Ruby have come from using the assignment operator when I really want a comparator.</p>

<p>I need to tattoo <code>= != ==</code> on the back of my hand.</p>
