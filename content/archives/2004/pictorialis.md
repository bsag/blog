<p>Having updated this blog to <a href="http://wordpress.org/" title="WordPress">WordPress</a>, I'm now turning my attention to my photoblog &mdash; <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/wingsopenwide/index.html" title="Old wings open wide">wings open wide</a>. I found a fantastic customisation of the standard WordPress install produced by <a href="http://dinki.mine.nu/weblog/" title="Mark's personal weblog">Mark</a>, called <a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2004/04/15/wordpress-photoblog-new-version/" title="Pictorialis">Pictorialis</a>. It has all the great features of WordPress, plus easy image uploads, and automatic resizing and thumbnailing of images. I've tinkered with the stylesheet a bit, and imported my posts from Movabletype.</p>

<p>One slight pain is that I have to wrap the main images in some <code><dl></code> and <code><dd></code> tags to get them to work properly with the template, so some of the older images currently look a bit weird. I'm gradually fixing them, along with making a few more minor changes to the <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and to the format of the archives, so that you can browse by category. I'm quite pleased with the way it's shaping up so far &mdash; have a <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/wingsopenwide/index.php" title="Sneaky peek of wings open wide 2">sneaky peek</a> if you want.</p>

<p>Once I'm happy with how it's working, I'll redirect the old URIs to the new entries, as I did with this site.</p>
