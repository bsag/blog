<p>I had to go into the library book stacks today, in search of a journal article. If you've never seen stacks before, they are <a href="http://www.borroughs.com/Products/HighDensity/AisleSaver.html" title="Borroughs shelving systems">huge rolling shelving systems</a> which can be stacked together or opened up to get at a particular shelf. They scare the life out of me, to the point where I'm reluctant to look up papers in journals with titles in the A-J range in the Psychology library. I always flip the pages in an unnecessarily noisy way so that no-one will accidentally crush me between the Journal of Abnormal Psychology and the Journal of Comparative Psychology. Apparently, I'm not the only one who <a href="http://wildcat.arizona.edu//papers/89/120/05_1_m.html" title="Arizona Daily Wildcat">worries</a> about this kind of thing.</p>

<p>I wonder how many people die in this way every year?</p>
