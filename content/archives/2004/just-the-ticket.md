<p>Yesterday I discovered the perfect antidote for reading too many undergraduate essays and spending four hours trying to explain complicated theoretical models when your head hurts: a glass of wine and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/hustle/" title="BBC - Hustle">Hustle</a> (not to be confused with Hustler). It's frothy, knowing, ultra-glossy, and best of all it has a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/hustle/actors/robert_vaughn.shtml" title="Robert Vaughn biography">Man From U.N.C.L.E</a>. You don't even need to trouble your brain with the plotâjust enjoy the fancy hardware and the frequent slow-motion shots of people in nice clothes walking away from office buildings. The slow-motion stylish walking is pointless, but surprisingly soothing to the troubled mind. There are also fertile Apple Mac<sup>1</sup> spotting opportunities.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> I felt that I should use the full designation here in case the word 'mac' conjured images of <a href="http://www.columbo-site.freeuk.com/" title="The ultimate Columbo site">Columbo</a>. The time that I did that Google search for "latex+mac" looking for <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/" title="LaTeX project homepage">LaTeX</a> installations is still etched on my memory.</p>
