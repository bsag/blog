<p>I've updated <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/wingsopenwide/index.php" title="Wings Open Wide">Wings Open Wide</a> with a few shots from the last film I took with the <a href="http://www.lomography.com/" title="Lomography">Lomo</a>. As sometimes happens with film cameras, I've had this film loitering around for so long that I had forgotten what was on it. This is both a disadvantage and a huge bonus of shooting on film. It's a lovely moment of surprise when you open the packet of prints and look into the past. This is doubly true when you use a Lomo &mdash; images very rarely turn out the way you expect, but there's a kind of magic in that.</p>
