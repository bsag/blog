We were watching a documentary we had recorded about religion and celibacy. Well, when I say 'we were watching', what I actually mean is that Mr. Bsag was watching while I surfed blogs and half listened but mostly didn't watch.

<p>
Suddenly Mr. Bsag says, "Look at those big knobs". Since the last image I glimpsed was of Hindu Sadhus doing very painful-looking things to their penises with long sticks, this immediately got my full attention. "Oh, you mean <em>those</em> kinds of knobs". It was footage of a lab in the 1960s with some heavy duty recording equipment with &mdash; yes &mdash; big knobs. That'll teach me not to try to parallel process.
