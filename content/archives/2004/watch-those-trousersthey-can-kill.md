<p>I found <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/health/story/0,3605,1012275,00.html" title="Guardian report on ROSPA accident statistics">this</a> very funny but also a little troubling; if about 0.008%<sup>1</sup> of Britons can't cope with even a simple and common article of clothing without doing themselves an injury, then the country is in desperate trouble. This quote really made me laugh:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to Rospa, trousers are responsible for more accidents than any other garment: "In the UK around 3,695 people attend hospital every year as a result of an accident with trousers," says spokeswoman Karen Blanchette. Among the incidents she recounts are "accidentally tripping because of a wide-flared trouser" and "putting your trousers on too quickly, losing your balance, and falling over".
</p></blockquote>
<p>I know that people complain about the 'nanny state', but I hadn't considered until now that it might be meant quite this literally.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Assuming that only people over 16 are stupid enough be unable to get their trousers on safely, the population of the UK over 16 is about <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/uk.asp" title="Census 2001">47 million</a>. I'm also assuming that the numbers aren't made up by a few people who repeatedly trip over their trousers. Perhaps this is a foolish assumption.</p>
