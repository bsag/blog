<p>Sometimes it would be really handy to have a search facility for finding the titles of films where you can't remember any of the words in the title, the director, or any of the actors. For example, this morning Mr. Bsag and I were trying to remember a great French film we saw a couple of years ago. Our search terms would have gone something like this:</p><blockquote><p>What was that French film with the welder who runs away from his wife and family and becomes a painter in Venice?</p></blockquote><p>We did eventually find the title &mdash; <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0284277/" title="Lundi Matin listing on IMDB">Lundi Matin</a>, in case you are interested &mdash; via a rather verbose Google search.</p>
