<p>I think it's about time that someone told Intel that <a href="http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20040202comp.htm" title="Behold! The Prescott!">their codename</a> for their new Pentium 4 processors is not going to play well in the UK. They obviously don't know the <a href="http://www.urban75.com/Punch/prescott.html" title="Slap Two Jags">John 'Two Jags' Prescott</a> that we all admire so much, or they wouldn't be burdening their technologically advanced, ground-breaking new chips with the name of someone who eats his with brown sauce and a pie.</p><p>Actually, you can tell a lot about a company by the codenames it chooses. When I think of Apple, I think of Jaguar, Panther and Tiger: sleek, fast, efficient creatures. And then there's Microsoft's Longhorn: a breed of cattle.</p><p> I rest my case.</p>
