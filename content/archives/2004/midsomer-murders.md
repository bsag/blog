<p>There must be something about Sunday nights that switches off my critical faculties and turns my brain to mush. I can find no other rational explanation for the fact that on Sunday I enjoy watching <a href="http://epguides.com/MidsomerMurders/guide.shtml" title="Episode guide - should give you a rough idea of the creakiness of the plots">Midsomer Murders</a>. For those unfamiliar with the British TV landscape, this show is classic Sunday night fare, featuring; lovely rural thatched cottage locations, mild tongue-in-cheekiness, great British Institutions (WI, bell ringers, Regattas etc.), and &mdash; of course &mdash; gruesome murder.</p>

<p>There are many reasons to find Midsomer Murders laughable<sup>1</sup>, but the thing that gets me every week is the sound effects. At some point, the people responsible for sound effects must have reasoned thusly:</p>

<ol>
<li>Midsomer is a rural area. </li>
<li>Rural areas have lots of foxes and owls.</li>
<li>Foxes and owls come out at night, and their calls are a bit spooky.</li>
<li>Therefore, every night scene should have a minimum of one fox scream or owl hoot per two seconds.</li>
</ol>

<p>If there were as many foxes in Midsomer as there appear to be from the soundtrack, the dead bodies would never actually hit the ground &mdash; instead, they would recline gently on a carpet of screaming foxes. If there was a <a href="http://www.bafta.org/">BAFTA</a> for "Most Gratuitous Use of Nocturnal Animal Cries and Calls" (and there should be) then Midsomer Murders would be a dead cert for the award.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>Not least of which is the stunning body count of an average of 3 murders per week in a tiny rural area. It's true that Inspector Morse had much the same problem, but Oxford is a little more urbanised, and anyway he carried it off with a bit of gravitas.</p>
