<p>I must be cursed. The other day---after having randomly heard the theme tune on some TV programme and remembered how much he liked it---Mr. Bsag found the <a href="http://home.att.net/~bubblegumusic/tralala.wav" title="Banana Splits theme - listen at your peril">theme to Banana Splits</a> on the web. As a 'surprise' for me, he played it to me very loudly at 6:30 am when I was barely functioning<sup>1</sup>. There can be few more tenacious <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/2004/02/05/touching-the-void/" title="Banana Splits theme - listen at your peril">soundworms</a> than this song. Somebody make it stop! Then today, one of the builders at work was merrily whistling the tune just outside my office door (as a thoughtful counterpoint to the sound of drilling and hammering). Will I never be free of it?</p><p>All together now, "Tra la la, la la la la, Tra la la, la la la la." Now I've infected all of you too. If I'm suffering, everyone should be.</p><p><sup>1</sup> I'm sure that there must be legal precedent for this being legitimate grounds for divorce.</p>
