<p>Mark Bernstein has <a href="http://markBernstein.org/Apr0401.html#note_35437" title="Why blog comments are bad">been commenting</a> on comments on blogs (if that isn't too recursive for you). He wrote:</p>

 <p>Comments don't belong in weblogs.</p>

<p>I don't agree, at least in a global way. First, I think that people are entitled to make whatever they want of their own weblog &mdash; it's their own space. Some people see their weblog as a kind of considered thinking space which they want to control quite tightly. Others welcome the interesting chaos that allowing commenting can provide. I'm definitely of the latter opinion.</p>

<p>Perhaps I've just been lucky &mdash; apart from comment spam and the odd childish contribution like "u smell"<sup>1</sup>, which I treat with the contempt and indifference they deserve, people who comment here mostly provide funny, informative and interesting contributions, and that adds greatly to this site. I suppose that if I ran a very political or controversial site, I might have more of a problem with trolls, but I still don't think that commenting <em>per se</em> is bad &mdash; it all depends on how well-behaved your audience is.</p>
