<p>The probably-final-ever series of <a href="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/B/blackbooks/" title="Channel 4 - Black Books">Black Books</a> has just ended, and I am in mourning. Along with <a href="http://www.spaced-out.org.uk/" title="Spaced">Spaced</a>, it's one of the best and most imaginative UK sitcoms in many long, dreary and âKeeping up Appearances'-filled years.</p>

<p>For those of you who haven't had the pleasure, Bernard Black owns a bookshop, but barely tolerates the customers. He's more of a misomni-ist than a misanthropist; apart from red wine and cigarettes, he loathes and detests everyone and everything. Manny is a sweet, cheerful, good-natured beardy hippie, who Bernard uses as a general dogsbody. Fran is an alcoholic who has nothing better to do, and so spends her time in the shop.</p>

<p>Last night, Manny and Fran tried to persuade Bernard to go to a party, only succeeding when they deceived him into thinking that the booze had run out:</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>[Manny, excited to be going to the party]: Let's paaaar... </p>
 <p>[Bernard, furiously pointing at Manny]: Don't you <em>dare</em> use 'party' as a verb in this shop!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later, after the party, Bernard muses on the evening's entertainment:</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>The drinks were few. The people were many. It was all I expected and less.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm really going to miss it, but I'm going to fill the void by reading these <a href="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/B/blackbooks/kidsclub.html" title="Kid's Club Book Reviews">hilarious book reviews</a> &mdash; 'Mastering Regular Expressions in Perl' is priceless.</p>
