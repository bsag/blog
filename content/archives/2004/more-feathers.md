<p>After <a href="http://www.chromasia.com/blog/" title="diachrony">djn1's</a> comment on yesterday's entry, and the photo he linked to, I remembered that I had taken a photo of a swan's feather a couple of years ago. The madly photoshopped results can be seen <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/wingsopenwide/archives/000611.html#000611" title="Dark feather">here</a>.</p>
