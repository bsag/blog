<p>I love this geeky love poem by KillerHamster which appeared in a comment on <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=95822&cid=8213745" title="What to get my geek for Valentine's Day?">Slashdot</a>:</p>
<pre>
<code>
Roses are #FF0000
Violets are #0000FF
chown -R you ~/base
</code>
</pre>
<p>I think it's a tribute to my geekoid status that I a) understand it, and b) would be really touched if someone sent me a poem like this.</p>
