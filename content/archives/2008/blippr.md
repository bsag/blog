<p>I've just signed up to a new service (currently in beta, natch) called <a href="http://www.blippr.com/">blippr</a>. You've probably already guessed from the missing 'e' that blippr is a social web service. It offers 'Radically Short Ratings and Reviews' for books, films, games and music. The idea is that you 'blip' items, rating them on a four-point scale and writing a short review if you like. It's a little like Twitter in that you only get 160 characters for your reviews, which is both a good and bad thing. If I really like something, I want more space than that to write about it, but on the other hand, I often put off writing about stuff I listened to, watched or read in my <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/media/archives/">media section</a>, because it will take too long to write a full review.</p>

<p>The real benefit is that -- when a few more people have signed up -- it should provide a great way for people with tastes you admire to recommend things you would probably enjoy. I've also started using it as a wishlist to note down things I'd like to get see, read or listen to. I tend to read reviews and get interested in something, then forget to note it down anywhere.</p>

<p>I've only just started using it, but it's interesting so far. My profile is <a href="http://www.blippr.com/profiles/bsag">here</a>, and if you'd like to try blippr for yourself, I have 3 invitations to give away.</p>
