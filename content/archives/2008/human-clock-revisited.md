<p>Some of you may remember when I recounted how I tend to use other people I encounter on my cycle commute in as a kind of <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/human-clock/">fuzzy human clock</a>. Well, it seems that other people do this too. Recently, I've been passing another cyclist at about the same point in my journey every day. We often smile and say hello as we pass, but today, I encountered him quite a bit further on in my own journey than usual. As he cycled by, he said something, which was almost lost to the wind and the Doppler Shift. But as I mentally reconstructed it, I realised that he'd said, "Crikey! Is it that time already?", and I laughed out loud.</p>
