<p>As regular readers will know, my <em>nom de keyboard</em> of 'bsag' and the title of this blog both refer to the look which comes over someone's face (usually male) when I exhibit signs of knowing something about technical matters (see my <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/about/" title="About page">About page</a> for more details).</p>

<p>I had a classic example of BSAG earlier this week when I had to contact some heating engineers about our boiler. We've dealt with these particular people before, and they are great: they are nice guys, do good work and charge a reasonable price. However, they really don't seem able to handle the fact that -- while neither Mr. Bsag and I are experts on heating systems -- I know a bit more about it than my husband. I started to explain what I thought the problem was, but they asked if they could speak to Mr. Bsag. I could have put my foot down, but since I'd dealt with them before (an experience very similar to those experienced by Arabella Weir's 'Invisible Woman' character on the Fast Show), I knew that it was a losing battle.</p>

<p>So I handed the phone over, and we had a farcical exchange where the heating engineers would ask Mr. Bsag some technical question on the phone, he would ask me, I would answer, and he would tell the engineers what I'd just said. It worked out OK in the end, because they came and fixed the problem (which was indeed a faulty control board, as I'd thought), but it would have been a bit easier if they'd actually believed that I knew what I was talking about. Sigh.</p>
