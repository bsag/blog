<p>An admin announcement: Feedburner has been bought by Google, so they are now administering the RSS feeds for this site. The feed should be redirected automatically to the new URL, but if it isn't, then please update your RSS reader with the new URL for the feed: <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/butshesagirl">http://feedproxy.google.com/butshesagirl</a>. I've changed the URLs on the page (such as the link in the sidebar to the right) to point to the new location.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
