<p>I had a dream the other night in which Mr. Bsag and I had not long moved into a new house (in reality, the last house we lived in, not the present one). We were in bed, asleep, in the early hours of the morning, when we got a phone call. It was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Trott">Ben</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mena_Grabowski_Trott">Mena Trott</a>, of <a href="http://movabletype.com/">Movable Type</a> fame, and Ben was crying. He told me that they were the previous occupants of the house, and -- by some mischance -- they had left the only remaining copy of the source code<sup id="r1-240608"><a href="#f1-240608">1</a></sup>  of Movable Type on an old computer in the house. He pleaded with me to make a copy and send it to him, but I had to tell him that we had got rid of the computer when we moved into the house. He was inconsolable, and I felt really bad about it.</p>

<p>My subconscious is weird sometimes.</p>

<p><sup id="f1-240608">1</sup> Yes, I know that since everyone who uses Movable Type has the source code, this can't possibly have been true, but it was a dream and therefore not big on logical consistency. <a href="#r1-240608">&uarr;</a></p>
