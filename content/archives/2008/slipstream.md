<p>I've started a tumblelog at <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>, called <a href="http://bsag.tumblr.com/">slipstream</a>. I'm mostly intending to use it a as way of collecting together snippets of things posted in other places (like flickr, Twitter and ma.gnolia), but it's also somewhere I can post things which are too short and inconsequential to post here. You might be wondering -- given the general level of inconsequentiality of stuff on but she's a girl -- what would count as too inconsequential, but still... Eventually, I hope to find some way of incorporating slipstream here as a kind of side-blog, so removing the need for the separate listings of twitters and ma.gnolia postings, but I haven't quite sorted out the best way to do it yet. Anyway, if you're interested, enjoy!</p>
