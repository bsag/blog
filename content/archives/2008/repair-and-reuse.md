<p>I've <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/upgrading-through-replacement-parts/">complained</a> before about the poor quality of modern appliances, and the difficulty of getting them repaired, and on occasions I've <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/gadget-overdose/">deliberately chosen</a> items because I know that spare parts were available. When I bought a Dyson vacuum cleaner several years ago, it was partly for the performance (which is great), and partly because they promised to be easy to repair.</p>

<p>We had to put that to the test recently, when our trusty Dyson cut out and failed to power on again. We investigated the many inspection hatches for any blockages, and washed the reusable filter, but it wouldn't turn on again. Luckily, we have a vacuum repair centre fairly close to us, and they are authorised Dyson distributors. The guy in the shop asked what had happened, and was confident they'd be able to fix it. A day later, our purple and green friend had a new power cable (which had developed a break inside the body of the machine), a few other worn parts were replaced, and it had a general service. The result is that our Dyson is working again, and we only had to pay a reasonable charge for the repair, rather than the full cost of a new one. There's also one less hunk of garish plastic in landfill.</p>

<p>I wish more manufacturers put thought in to making their products easy to repair, and provided a supply of easily obtainable spare parts.</p>
