                <div class="delicious-extended">Photographer David White recreated the camera that Robert Howlett used to take the famous portrait of Brunel standing if front of a cascade of huge chains. White&#039;s series of photographs of Brunel&#039;s various works around the country are wonderful and the long exposure times filter out fast moving things leaving only Brunel&#039;s wonderful, solid architecture. I&#039;d love to see the prints in person.</div>
