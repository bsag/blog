<p>I've finally signed up at <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/bsag/">last.fm</a>. I don't know why I resisted for so long, but the increase in the numbers of full tracks that they feature was certainly an encouragement <img src="http://www.rousette.org.uk/images/smileys/grin.gif" width="19" height="19" alt="grin" style="border:0;" />. I do sometimes listen to the radio stations at work when I'm away from my main iTunes library, but I'm mainly interested in it as a way of discovering new artists. A 'similar artists' station turned up 'Iron &amp; Wine', who I had never heard of before. I liked him (yes, it is just a 'him' rather than a 'they') so much that I bought 'The Shepherd's Dog' recently, as you can see from my recently scrobbled tracks.</p>

<p>It's also interesting to look back at your listening habits. It isn't completely characteristic of all my music listening, because I also listen to CDs on the stereo downstairs, but I seem to oscillate between fairly random playlists of a wide range of my collection and intensively listening to a few albums straight through. I'm in the latter mode right now, it seems.</p>

<p>I haven't really done anything with the social side of last.fm yet (if you're on there and think you might enjoy my musical tastes, do point me to your username), and I wish that the player integrated with iTunes rather than using a standalone player, but otherwise I'm liking it a lot.</p>
