<p>A couple of days ago, I came home to find that I had received a call from the security department of my credit card provider. I panicked a bit, of course, but called them straight away. They told me that they had flagged up a couple of transactions as <em>suspicious</em>, and gave me the details of the dodgy items. To my great relief, the transactions had actually been made by me, so there was no problem.</p>

<p>I have no idea why those particular transactions were seen as suspicious, but I'd certainly rather have a few false positives than for them to miss genuinely fraudulent transactions. I was also quite impressed that they phoned me to check. However, the whole experience did feel a little bit like my Mum reading my credit card statement and pointing out items in a slightly disapproving way: "Now, this one here -- did you really need to buy that, it was rather pricey. And this one, what was that for?"</p>
