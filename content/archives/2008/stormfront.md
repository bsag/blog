<p>Cycling home today, I had a storm-front behind me. Ahead, all was blue sky, sunshine and fluffy white clouds; behind, deep bruise-grey clouds and a fat rainbow. I was being soaked by the rain, while simultaneously feeling the sun warm my wet face. I felt as if I was pulling the storm-front along in my slipstream.</p>

<p>Of course, that wasn't what was happening. I'm not (yet) egotistical enough or crazy enough<sup id="r1-140408"><a href="#f1-140408">1</a></sup> to believe that I control the weather. But sometimes, what a thing feels like is more interesting than what it actually is.</p>
