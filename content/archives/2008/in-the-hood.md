<p>As a postscript to <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/in-which-our-plans-go-astray/">yesterday's post</a>, while I was writing it, I wasn't sure of my spelling of Robert Burns' <em>gang aglae</em> and decided to do a quick Google search to check. Google kindly asked me if I perhaps meant "gang algae", which I found a charming notion.</p>

<p>Yes, those gang algae are always hanging around in their slimy green hoodies, throwing floppy gang signs and corrupting all the young, innocent liverworts and mosses in the neighbourhood. Something ought to be done!</p>
