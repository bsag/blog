<p>I've been meaning to link to <a href="http://idlewords.com/2008/04/controlled_tango_into_terrain.htm">this article</a> by Maciej Ceglowski for ages, but forgetting to do it. I love Maciej's writing: he doesn't post very frequently, but when he does, it's really worth waiting for. He's really funny (I laughed out loud several times while reading this piece), but he also has a wonderful way of evoking the feeling of a place, and making you feel as if you know the characters he writes about. </p>

<p>My favourite part, however, is right at the end:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Each week I brute force my way through a dance with these gracious partners, and each week they are quick to assure me it wasn't nearly as much of a Calvary for them as it had been the week before. As one of them said to me sweetly after what I thought was a rare successfully-executed figure, "Don't worry. Someday you will know what you are doing."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I feel like that all the time -- someday I will know what I am doing.</p>
