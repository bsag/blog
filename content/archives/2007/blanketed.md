<p>I noticed yesterday that the rain coming down was a little more solid (and colder) than usual, but I didn't really expect it to snow properly. We were going to do some work on the allotment, but chickened out because of the foul weather, and spent the day cosily inside, reading, listening to music, and in my case, writing installation and upgrade instructions for the next version of Tracks.</p>

<p>We closed all the curtains before it got properly dark, so it was a bit of a shock when I went into the kitchen at about 10.30, and saw an eerie glow outside. At first, I thought our security light had come on outside, but I gradually realised that the glow (I'll you'll forgive the rhyme) was coming from snow. It was at least 4 or 5 cm deep, and still falling, giving the sky a strange orange cast.</p>

<p>By this morning, it had mostly melted with remnants of greying mush, but the effect last night was quite magical because it was so unexpected.</p>
