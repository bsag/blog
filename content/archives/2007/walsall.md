<p>Mr. Bsag and I went to Walsall yesterday -- my first visit to the town. I'm not quite sure what I was expecting (it's very easy to have negative pre-conceptions about a lot of Midlands towns because they have been the butt of jokes for years), but I was pleasantly surprised. It is never going to be a tourist destination, but it has a very nice feel about it.</p>

<p>For a start, it seems to have managed to hold on to one or two independent shops alongside the usual high street suspects that spread like fungus over most British towns. I might be a vegetarian, but I still like to see proper, family-run butchers shops that appear to be doing a brisk trade. It was a lovely day, which always helps, but people were wandering around the pedestrianised streets looking happy and relaxed, rather than having that "MUST BUY CONSUMER GOODS" zombie-like expression that you often see around shopping centres.</p>

<p>Walsall also has a very nice art gallery, which proudly (and prominently) displays "Free Admission" under the name on the outside, so as not to deter shy and/or poor potential art lovers. I enjoyed a good wander around it, and took some pictures (<a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/wingsopenwide/full/38/">one</a>, <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/wingsopenwide/full/39/">two</a> and <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/wingsopenwide/full/40/">three</a>). They have an exhibition of <a href="http://www.andrewtift.co.uk/">Andrew Tift's</a> portraits of Kitty Garman on at the moment, and they are really captivating. <a href="http://www.andrewtift.co.uk/kitty.shtml">Kitty</a><sup id="r1-110807"><a href="#f1-110807">1</a></sup> seems to be quite a woman, and the portraits show the intelligence and wit and life in her eyes beautifully.</p>

<p>There also seemed to be a lot of activities on for children in the streets (no doubt organised to coincide with the school holidays). There were several puppet shows, Punch and Judy booths (complete with a gaggle of kids sitting rapt on a blanket in front of the booth doing the full 'He's behind you!' thing), puppet making workshops, a giant monk puppet accompanied by two Medieval bagpipers, and a cheerful man riding inside a huge, papier mach&eacute; crocodile. I have no idea what the latter two were about, but they were certainly entertaining, and the whole thing gave the town quite a lively creative air -- again, not what I was expecting from Walsall.</p>

<p><sup id="f1-110807">1</sup> Daughter of sculptor Jacob Epstein and first wife of Lucien Freud. I hate describing women solely in terms of their relationship to men, but that -- unfortunately -- is how she is known. Judging by the look in her eyes, there's an awful lot more to her than just being a daughter and a wife. <a href="#r1-110807">&uarr;</a></p>
