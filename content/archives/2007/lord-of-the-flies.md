<p>Now that summer seems to be a-coming in, midges and mosquitos are breeding like -- well -- flies. My morning ride is fine because it's fairly early and the midges don't seem to be swarming, but on the ride home, I have to wear sunglasses to avoid getting midges in my eyes every few minutes. I don't mind getting a bug-splattered face, but flies in the eye <em>hurt</em>.</p>

<p>There's one particular stretch by the river which is particularly infested. I was behind a little boy who was on a bike with training wheels in 'Midge Alley'. He started flapping one arm around his head, while continuing to pedal at his top speed, and I knew exactly what he was doing. His arm-whirling got more and more frantic, until he hurled himself off his bike, thrashing the air around his head as if he was being assailed by invisible bees.</p>

<p>It was like watching some kind of pocket, low-budget action film. Like 'Speed' our hero has to keep his pedalling speed above 10 mph, or he will be devoured alive by midges! May contain scenes of Mild Peril.</p>
