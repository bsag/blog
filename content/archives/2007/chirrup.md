<p>One endearing characteristic of <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/hello-kitty/">Somali cats</a> (well, one of their many endearing characteristics) is their chirrup. Where other cats miaow or yowl, Somalis chirrup. Imagine someone pronouncing a rolling 'r' (as in Spanish<sup id="r1-10807"><a href="#f1-10807">1</a></sup>) with a rising, musical inflection, which sometimes ends in a miaow-like sound. I've never heard a cat make a sound like that before, and it makes me smile every time.</p>

<p>The other night, during a protracted chirruping bout before her dinner, I realised that the sound reminded me of something else: Chewbacca on helium. All she needs is a little bandolier and a cat-sized space ship, and she's all set.</p>

<p><sup id="f1-10807">1</sup> Which I have just discovered, courtesy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_trill">Wikipedia</a>, is called an <em>alveolar trill</em>. <a href="#r1-10807">&uarr;</a></p>
