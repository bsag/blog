<p>A snapshot from my cycle commute home on Friday:</p>

<p>An elderly gent is walking through the park with his portly, grizzled, leg-at-each-corner labrador. They are side by side, ambling along at the same, easy pace. It has just stopped raining, and the man furls his golfing umbrella, casually offering it to his dog. Without breaking stride, the dog takes the umbrella in his mouth and carries it. They stroll on, as they probably do every day, taking each others' presence for granted in the best possible way.</p>
