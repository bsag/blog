<p>When I was in school, we used to be allowed to take in board games for the last day of term. Right now, I really wish paid employment followed the same pattern. I've got a pile of things to do before I finish for Christmas on Friday, but I'm so exhausted that I'm having tremendous difficulty getting them done.</p>

<p>All I really want to do is play Hungry Hippos or Cluedo with my friends. And while we're about it, I wouldn't mind a four week long holiday.</p>
