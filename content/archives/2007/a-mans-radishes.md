<p>Today is an exciting day! We got our first properly edible crop from the allotment -- our first 'Long Red' radishes. They are supposed to be long (as the name suggests), but they're not supposed to have leaves with lots of holes in them. I think something had a bit of a nibble, but the radishes themselves are fine. I can't tell you how proud I am of this little bunch.</p>

<p>I had a couple for lunch today, very fresh from the ground. They were juicy and crisp, and properly hot and radishy, unlike the the woolly, bland little radishes you get from the supermarket. Or as we say in our house (referencing an obscure Blackadder episode) -- A Man's Radishes.</p>
