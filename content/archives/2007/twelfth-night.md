<p>I think it should be obvious from the picture that our Christmas tree this year was not of the greatest quality. I'm surprised it made it to Twelfth Night. Despite supplying it with copious amounts of water, it dropped piles of needles at the slightest provocation. By the time we'd finished removing the decorations on Friday, it was more or less just bare branches. It was also the most deformed looking tree I've ever seen, like a larger and only slightly less sad-looking version of <a href="http://boingboing.net/2005/11/09/replica_of_charlie_b.html">Charlie Brown's Christmas tree</a>.</p>

<p>Mind you, it was extremely cheap, so I suppose we got what we paid for, and I actually find hoovering up needles quite enjoyable. Still, it is quite nice to be able to open the dining room curtains without the accompanying patter of needles hitting carpet.</p>
