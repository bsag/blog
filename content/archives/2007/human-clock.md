<p>Commuters tend to be creatures of habit, and I am no exception. My return journey timing is a bit more variable, but I tend to leave for work at about the same time everyday. The same is true of many other people I pass along the way, so they become a kind of fuzzy human clock.</p>

<p>You know where you normally tend to pass other commuters travelling on your route in the opposite direction, so if you see them earlier along your route, it's a pretty safe bet that you're a bit late. Similarly, if you see them when you're nearer to your destination, you might be a bit earlier than usual. I recently realised that I was subconsciously using these kinds of encounters to roughly gauge my timekeeping, and found it quite funny that -- inconstant creatures though we are -- much of our behaviour is predictable enough to set your watch by. Things do fall apart a bit if your 'reference person' happens to be running early or late too, though, but I have a watch to check.</p>
