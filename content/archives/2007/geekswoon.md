<p>Oh. My. Giddy. <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">Aunt</a>.</p>

<p>I am not a woman who swoons, but following the liveblogging of the Apple Keynote on <a href="http://www.macrumorslive.com/">Macrumorslive</a> -- waiting with bated breath for every 60 second auto-refresh (Quick! I've got 60 seconds to run to the bathroom...) -- I very nearly had a quiet geekly swoon.</p>

<p>So shiny.</p>

<p>It's not just the amazing hardware advances (a multi-touch touchscreen, 2 MP camera, 8GB memory, <em>and</em> two batteries in that tiny, elegant package), but the wonderful software implementations (automatic flipping of the layout of a photo or webpage from portrait to landscape as you tilt the phone, proximity sensors, etc, etc.). And the colours! And the shiny, lovely icons!</p>

<p>Ahem. Forgive me. I haven't been quite this breathlessly excited about an Apple Keynote in a couple of years. They've had some lovely stuff, but nothing that really blew the top of my head off. When I heard the rumours about an iPhone, I was sure that it was going to a) not appear, or b) be a bit of a disappointment. I really don't know quite how they've done it, but they certainly haven't disappointed.</p>

<p>Oh dear, I can see that I've got some serious saving and cost justifications to make to Mr. Bsag before the end of this year. And I bet the mobile phone company they use in the UK isn't who my existing contract is with.</p>
