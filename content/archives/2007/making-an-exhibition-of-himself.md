Mr. Bsag has been producing some cracking etchings<sup id="r1-070207"><a href="#f1-070207">1</a></sup> and prints recently. I think they're wonderful, and -- at long last -- other people are starting to think so too. This week, he's had two prints accepted for two different exhibitions. The first is the [Friends of the RBSA](http://www.rbsa.org.uk/exhibitions/index.htm) exhibition at the RBSA, and the second is the [Birmingham Open](http://www.bmag.org.uk/index.php?type=event&maincat=3&subcat=0&subelement=0&eventid=202) at the Gas Hall, Birmingham. The RBSA exhibition runs until the 17th February, and the Birmingham Open runs from this Saturday until 29th April. If you're in Birmingham and at a loose end for an hour or so, do go along. I *think* both exhibitions are free. Of course, if you also have a few quid knocking about, a space on a wall, and feel like buying Mr. Bsag's work, that would be very welcome <img src="http://www.rousette.org.uk/images/smileys/grin.gif" width="19" height="19" alt="grin" style="border:0;" />.
