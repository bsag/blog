<p>Sod's Law, Section 16.8, Paragraph 12:</p>

<p>Commencement of a severe cold or other non-life threatening but messy and energy-sapping illness with implications for the vocal chords shall coincide neatly with the only important public event at which the aforementioned party is engaged to speak within one calendar month either side of the aforesaid illness.</p>

<p>And so, the public lecture I've been looking forward to/dreading<sup id="r1-270207"><a href="#f1-270207">1</a></sup> delivering for several months has coincided with a really horrible cold. I hope that I'm going to still be able to do it (so long as my voice holds out), but I'm likely to be doing my uncanny impression of a 13 year old boy whose voice is breaking. It should be... interesting.</p>
