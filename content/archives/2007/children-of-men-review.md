<p>I know that people sometimes don't notice my reviews over in the sidebar on the right, so I'll point out that I'm <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/media/archives/children-of-men/">currently raving</a> about <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000J4P9YO/butshesagirl-21/">Children of Men</a> which we saw last night. It's definitely one of the best films I've seen in a while.</p>

<p><em>Update 2007-04-23</em>: For those of you who commented here and found that your comments disappeared, do not fear! It seems that having the same url title for this posting and the <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/media/archives/children-of-men/">actual review</a>, I had inadvertantly created some kind of comment worm hole, such that comments posted here ended up attached to the actual review. I've changed the url title for this entry now, so hopefully it shouldn't happen anymore. Many thanks to <a href="http://briantanaka.com/">Brian Tanaka</a> for solving the mystery!</p>
