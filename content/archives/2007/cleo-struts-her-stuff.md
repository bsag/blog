<p>I've managed to take a few vaguely presentable pictures of Cleo, which I've uploaded to Wings Open Wide (<a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/wingsopenwide/full/35/">1</a>, <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/wingsopenwide/full/34/">2</a>, <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/wingsopenwide/full/33/">3</a> and <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/wingsopenwide/full/32/">4</a>). Despite giving us a bit of a scare last night when she was very under the weather, she's back to her normal chirpy self today, and is doing really well. She's staring at me right now, trying to persuade me (I think) to stop this silly blogging and do something more important like giving her a good cuddle and stroke instead. So I'd better obey my feline overlord (or should I say overlady?) and do her bidding.</p>
