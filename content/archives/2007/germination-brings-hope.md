<p>I sowed some 'Sweet Chocolate' <a href="http://realseeds.co.uk/sweetpeppers.html">pepper seeds</a> a few weeks ago in the airing cupboard, because they need at least 25&deg;C to germinate, and apparently you need to get them started early in the UK to get a long enough growing season. They've done better than I could possibly have hoped, as you can see above. It's really the first time I've ever grown anything from seed, and I was watching them constantly for signs of life. When I saw the first tiny white shoots poking through the compost, I was really excited. Despite the fact that I'm a biologist, and in theory know how it works, I find it magical that you can bury a tiny, dead-looking seed in compost, water it, and eventually get a whole plant.</p>

<p>One of the things I hadn't anticipated was how rewarding it is growing from seed, and how it gives you a deep feeling of hope that summer will eventually come. When it is cold, damp and foggy outside, I peer closely at those vivid green, fragile little shoots, and immediately think of the hot summer sun turning the fruits sweet and juicy.</p>

<p>It's not an original observation, and sounds irritatingly hippyish and new-agey into the bargain, but growing from seed, harvesting and saving seed for the next year (which I also intend to do) does seem to help you to connect yourself to the future and the past. It helps you to see life as a cycle with things to enjoy and look forward to as they come around again, rather than a kind of Sisyphean unending toil. </p>
