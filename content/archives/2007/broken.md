<p>I apologise for the silence around here (and for any unanswered emails), but my laptop hard drive died on Monday, so I'm in computing limbo-land. I'm camping out on Mr. Bsag's iMac, but that means I can't do anything computer related at work, so there's a lot of running about and improvisation going on.</p>

<p>Luckily, I had a backup from late on Saturday (backing up is boring until the instant you need it, and then you are incredibly grateful that you took the trouble to do it regularly), so I shouldn't have lost much data. However, there's a lot of organisation to do when I get a replacement or a fix, which is not a good thing when I have a deadline looming on Thursday.</p>

<p>I'll be glad when it's all over, and I'm back on my own, configured-just-how-I-like-it machine.</p>
