<p>In a fit of messing about, I signed up for <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> this week. I haven't yet decided if it's fun or a total waste of time (or both), but if you're on Twitter too, my username is (naturally) <a href="http://twitter.com/bsag">bsag</a>, and I'd love to know yours.</p>

<p>Incidentally, if you use a Mac, <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">Twitterrific</a> makes using Twitter much easier, and -- importantly -- easier to turn off when you need to concentrate.</p>
