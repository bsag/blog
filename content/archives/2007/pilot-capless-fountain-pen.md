<p>It was my birthday last week, and I got some money from some very kind and generous friends and family members. I wrote a while ago about my lovely <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/fountain-pens/">Rotring Newton</a> fountain pen, and I'm afraid that I've enjoyed using it so much in the intervening time that the fountain pen bug has struck. I've been admiring the <a href="http://www.namiki.com/collections/pilotVanishingPoint_RA.php">Pilot Vanishing Point</a> fountain pens (or Pilot Capless or Namiki Vanishing Point -- they go under a confusing array of names), and since I had some gift money to treat myself with, I decided to buy one.</p>

<p>I looked at them a while ago, and thought that they were probably a bit expensive, but then found an online retailer, <a href="http://www.cultpens.com">Cult Pens</a> which stocks them at a very good price, and also keeps all the nib sizes in stock. While I still love my Rotring, there are a couple of things that make it slightly less practical for note-taking use at work. This sounds trivial, but taking the cap on and off (to stop the nib drying out) while intermittently taking notes on a talk is a little inconvenient. I'm also prone to misplacing or dropping the cap when I do so, because it isn't terribly secure when parked on the end of the pen. The second is probably a function of nib width, but the medium nib on the Rotring lays down quite a wet line. This looks nice, and makes for a smooth stroke, but I then tend to smudge it if writing quickly.</p>

<p>I think that the Pilot Capless will solve both of those problems. The retractable nib is a bit of an engineering marvel and works very well. It sounds like a gimmick, but having a fountain pen you can use with the convenience of a ball point is fantastic. I got the fine nib, which lays down a <em>very</em> fine line of around 0.5 mm or less with the Noodler's Legal Lapiz ink I'm using. It's almost like a Pilot V5 fineliner, but the line is very smooth and constant. At that width, the ink dries almost instantly, and I've even found that I can use it on newsprint to solve a crossword without the ink spreading. The pocket clip looks like it would get in the way of your fingers, but at least with my grip, I find that it stops my fingers slipping on the barrel, and helps to keep them in a good position for writing.</p>

<p>It's a really lovely experience to write with, and quite a different feel to the Rotring. I keep finding excuses to write little notes or lists with it, because it's such a sensual thing. I think it's going to be a great notetaker at work, and I'll use my Rotring for more leisurely writing at home.</p>

<p>I would also really recommend <a href="http://www.cultpens.com">Cult Pens</a> to anyone buying pens in the UK. It happened that the finish I originally chose (Black Carbonesque) was out of stock, and was on back order for a number of weeks when the delivery they were expecting didn't materialise. They consequently offered me a discount on another finish, and sent the pen Special Delivery so it would arrive the next day -- great service! I'm not affiliated with them, by the way, just a happy customer, and I think that good service deserves public praise.</p>
