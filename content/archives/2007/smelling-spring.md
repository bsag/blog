<p>After all the rain last week, we've had some wonderful Spring weather recently. It's been bright and crisp, and at long last, I can smell Spring coming -- literally. Now that my cold is finally going, I can smell the grass beginning to grow again, the bulbs blooming and -- best of all -- the almond trees along my route to work are in full, delicious blossom. Taking a deep breath and filling my head with almond blossom smell is my favourite part of the day.</p>
