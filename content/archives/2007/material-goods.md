<p>I read an <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/stuff.html">excellent article</a> by Paul Graham a while ago about the perils of accumulating possessions, and the way that they can weigh you down as you subconsciously worry about them. It's not a novel observation, of course, but he sets out the problem very clearly.</p>

<p>I also worry about how much 'stuff' I have, even though I'm not (by current standards) a particularly materialistic or acquisitive person. Even so, it's horribly easy to acquire a mountain of possessions, which becomes startlingly (and expensively) apparent when you move house. I hate buying clothes, but because of that, I don't throw away old clothes until they are literally falling apart. So even a very modest rate of acquisition of new clothes means that the storage starts to burst at the seams. You can imagine how bad the situation is for things that I <em>enjoy</em> buying, like music, books and electronics.</p>

<p>I've been trying to wean myself off the accumulation habit. My motivation is partly to do with reducing my spending, partly out of a wish to reduce my environmental impact, but also just to step off the consumer treadmill and have less stuff. Now that we have a library so conveniently close to our house, I don't buy books unless it's a reference book that will be useful for many years, or a particularly treasured novel that I'll read again many times. We rent DVDs from <a href="http://www.lovefilm.com/">LOVEFiLM</a> for general viewing, and only buy DVDs when we know it's something we'll watch many times (like The Big Lebowski or Firefly). I've also instituted a kind of self-imposed 'cooling-off period' for other non-essential purposes. If what I'm thinking of buying isn't replacing something broken, I make myself wait a month before buying it. I think about it, price up alternatives and so on, but I just don't buy it for a month. If I still want it at the end of that time, I go ahead, but often I find that the urge has worn off as I find that my life has miraculously gone along unhindered, despite the lack of that thing I thought was so important to my happiness. Don't get me wrong -- I like a lot of my stuff, and I'm not about to sit cross-legged in an empty white cube any time soon. I just want to whittle things down a set of items that actually <em>enhance</em> my life.</p>

<p>I also read a piece by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,,2152377,00.html">Stuart Jeffries</a> in the Guardian about the rise in popularity of services which allow rental of goods, rather than ownership. His point was that this was symptomatic of 'commitment phobia', but I actually think that renting rather than owning things is <em>good thing</em> (with the exception of the pet rental service mentioned - that's an appalling idea). It's an anti-materialistic feeling, and it's probably better for the environment: why own a car or bike or expensive clothes that you'll only use occasionally, when you can rent it and share the usage of one item with others?</p>

<p>I always laugh when I property shows on TV, where couples without children want a four or five bedroom house. Really, what are they going to do with all that space? Why do they need it? If they both work at home, they might need a couple of extra rooms to turn into offices, but after that, it's hard to see why all that space is necessary. The problem is a circular one -- as Paul Graham mentioned, the more stuff you have, the more space you need to house it all. But when you get a bigger place, you need more stuff to kit out the rooms as well (TVs, audio equipment, decorative items). Before you know it, you need a six bedroom house, even though there are only two of you. It's craziness, and I want to get out of it.</p>
