<p>If you subscribe to my <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/butshesagirl">FeedBurner feed</a> you may have noticed (or will notice) small adverts at the bottom of each article, which have appeared recently. I haven't actually seen them myself yet, because the first ad appeared to be geographically targeted to US readers, but they are supposed to be appearing in the feed right now.</p>

<p>It's a bit of an experiment, really. For one reason or another, I could really do with a little extra income right now (well, I could really do with a <em>lot</em> of extra income, but I'm not greedy or optimistic), and while I don't want to put adverts on the site, I thought that having adverts in the feed might be less annoying for readers but bring in a little bit of money. Or it might really annoy readers, and bring in no money, I just don't know yet. So I'm going to try it for a month or so and see how it goes. If you feel strongly about it, let me know!</p>
