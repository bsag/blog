<p>There's a new version of <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/index.html" title="Tinderbox">Tinderbox</a> out---get it while it's hot! I couldn't find the change notes on Eastgate's page, but on <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/14057" title="Tinderbox 1.2.3 on VersionTracker">VersionTracker</a>, the following improvements are listed:</p>

<blockquote>Better support for languages with non-Roman scripts. Mouse wheel support. Quick-stamps and actions let you set prototypes even faster. New markup makes it easier to export outlines and to simplify complex families of export templates. </blockquote>
