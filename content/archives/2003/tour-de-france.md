<p>Just about the only sport I bother to watch is cycling: more specifically the <a href="http://www.letour.fr/2003/us/index.html">Tour de France</a>. Before we go any further, my interest has nothing at all to do with the plethora of rather fit men wearing tight lycra. Honestly. I think that anyone who does the Tour is practically certifiable. It's nearly 3,500 km of hell over three weeks, some of it up gradients that most people would only contemplate attempting with the help of ropes and oxygen masks. One competitor had to pull out before the tour because he was undergoing surgery for a saddle sore. The very idea of a saddle sore so severe that it requires surgery makes me wince.</p>

<p>Yesterday's stage was the Prologue &mdash; a 6.5 km individual time trial held in Paris. We had high hopes for David Millar &mdash; an up and coming British rider, who is a natural on the time trials. When we saw that his time half way round the course was a full 5 seconds ahead of the fastest time, we thought he was a certainty for the yellow jersey. Bear in mind that most of the times were within fractions of a second of one another, so 5 seconds was a huge margin. Unfortunately, typical British sporting luck intervened, and Millar's chain came off on the second part of the course. In the end, the Australian rider, Brad McGee, beat Millar by fractions of a second.</p>

<p>This year is the Tour's centenary, so it's a special year. After several years in the wilderness of Eurosport on Sky, the Tour is now being shown on free terrestrial digital TV (ITV2), so we're enjoying being able to watch it again.</p>
