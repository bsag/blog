<p>It's not often---or ever---that I post about political matters here. This is partly because I know that I wouldn't do it justice, but also because I think that political/moral issues are just too complicated to discuss in a short piece of writing. But <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uklatest/story/0,1271,-2398643,00.html" title="Blair warns marcher of 'moral choice'">this statement</a> by Tony Blair really made me go, ``What!":</p>

<blockquote>Mr Sawford asked: ``Do you have a message for the people on that rally, bearing in mind that many of them are your friends, not your enemies."
Mr Blair replied: "First of all that we should be glad that we live in a country, this country, not the case in Iraq, where people can come together and demonstrate their position on political issues of the day."
Speaking about possible war he added: "The alternative is to carry on with a sanctions regime which, because of the way Saddam implements it, actually has resulted in thousands of people dying needlessly in Iraq every year.
"So I hope when people go on that march that they at least recognise that those of us that take a different view hold our views with as much conviction and sincerity as they hold theirs."
</blockquote>

<p>Um, yes? Isn't that rather the point? We <em>are</em> lucky to live in a democracy, and so we have a duty to protest when we feel that our representatives are doing something that we don't agree with. Furthermore, our representatives have a duty to listen to us, particularly when opinions are expressed by so many people. Of course the issue of whether or not to go to war is a highly complex one, but---irrespective of which option you favour---everyone's voice should be heard, and the majority opinion should guide the eventual decision of the Government. Otherwise, we're a democracy in name only: we're perfectly welcome to congregate in London shout as loudly as we like (now that the Government has reluctantly decided that the precious turf in Hyde Park can be sacrificed in the name of freedom), but nothing will actually change.</p>
