<p>So, you probably noticed that I posted my first mobile blog entries yesterday and this morning, and wondered what was going on. Well, I was prompted to embark on this adventure--further freeing myself from the tyranny of cables--for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>I got a <a href="http://handspring.com/products/communicators/treo600_overview.jhtml;jsessionid=WP2V4ATWWKPM5QFIAE1CFFGAVAATKIV0">Treo 600</a> Palm-based phone a week or so ago (a long story which I intend to tell in the next few days, as well as reviewing this brilliant bit of kit)</li>
<li>Via a discussion thread in the comments of an entry on <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001543.shtml#001543">Dan Gillmor's</a>, I found a service called <a href="http://new.bastish.net/cgi-bin/mfop2/index.cgi?rm=about">Mfop2</a> which lets you upload entries via email, once you have registered your details. If you attach a picture to the email--the Treo has a typically poor, but nevertheless serviceable camera built in--then that gets uploaded too</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't know how often I'll actually blog on the move, but it is quite fun, and using Mfop2 was much easier than writing a custom script[1]. Even with a keyboard on the Treo, typing long articles isn't easy. And it may not always be obvious in the end product, but I do like to put a fair bit of time and thought into what I write, which isn't really compatible with blogging on a handheld. Still, it's nice to have an alternative for when I'm feeling spontaneous.</p>

<p>[1] Once I had hit my forehead in frustration after realising that the new entry was not showing on the index page because I hadn't included the new MoBlogging category in the template.</p>
