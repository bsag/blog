<p class="img-shadow"><img src="http://www.rousette.org.uk/images/uploads/graffiti.jpg" border="0" alt="image" name="image" width="160" height="120" />A rather literate graffti artist has been making his or her presence felt around Oxford recently. In case you can't read it, this says, "Sois r&eacute;aliste demande l'impossible". I get the gist, but if any Fracophones have a decent translation, let me know. It's written in chalk, not paint, so the person responsible has some respect for the buildings.</p>
