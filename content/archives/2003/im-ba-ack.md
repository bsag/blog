<p>I've come back with a cold, a cough that makes bystanders edge away from me for fear that I might have <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,4161-631108,00.html">SARS</a> and some fantastic memories. My ears also popped on the way back to earth and I now have interesting some interesting new auditory sensations -- an underwater sound complete with sonar ping in my left ear and a high pitched whistle in my right. Ah, the joys of air travel. I wouldn't normally whinge about  illness on this page, but I've also got raging jet-lag so my willpower is low.</p>

<p>Normal service will hopefully resume soon, though I will fly in the face of chronology and post some more entries from Florida before I catch up with myself. It is also likely that none of this will make any sense tomorrow (or today, or whenever I am).</p>

<p>By the way, I notice that a couple of little trolls have visited the comments (see <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/smarten-up-your-quotes">Smarten up your quotes</a> and <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/tiny-fluffy-kittens">Tiny fluffy kittens</a>) while I've been away -- what's the ettiquette: delete them or leave them there for the edification of others?</p>
