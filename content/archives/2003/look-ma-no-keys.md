<p>I really should stop reading <a href="http://www.macslash.org/articles/03/06/12/2023257.shtml">MacSlash</a>. Not only do I have to wade through a lot of trolls, I see something ultra-cool and ultra-geeky and I want it &mdash; and be damned with the expense. Needless to say, I want one of these <a href="http://www.fingerworks.com/TS_PowerBook.html">zero-force keyboard replacements</a> from Fingerworks. I tried to find out if there are any resellers in the UK or elsewhere in Europe, and came upon this <a href="http://www.arktis.de/shop/kategorie/machardware.html" title="Arktis">German site</a>, which sells the iGesture Pad. I love the description:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
F&eacute;Â¼hlen Sie sich wie Tom Cruise in Minority Report!

<p>Now, I only did a year of German at school, and virtually all I remember is that the verb comes at the end, but I think we all know what that means. By coincidence, I've been getting a bit worried about RSI lately. I've started getting pains and nerve spasms in my hands. Yesterday, the little finger on my left hand kept twitching, and I ended up typing far too many 'a's. I wonder if I could wangle a Touchstream from the Occupational Health service at work?</p>
