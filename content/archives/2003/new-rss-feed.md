<p>The newest build of <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/probeta/" title="NetNewsWire Pro">NetNewsWire Pro</a> allows the display of the date and category of a post. It's a really nice feature, but to take advantage of it, you need my RSS 1.0 feed. Click on the XML Summaries image in the sidebar and copy the resulting URL into NetNewsWire's subscribe dialogue. Even if you use another news reader, I would appreciate it if you could use the new feed. In news readers that support it, it will only fetch headlines if there is anything new available, which saves my bandwidth.</p>

<p>While I'm on the subject, if any of you have clicked on my XHTML or CSS validation links recently, you are probably thinking, "You big fat liar - it doesn't validate!" Oops. A few errors had crept into the XHTML when I forgot to switch off automatic paragraph generation when I added my own paragraph tags, and there were a few other minor problems. I broke the CSS when I updated the design a few days ago. I think I've sorted all the problems out now, but let me know if you find any other errors.</p>
