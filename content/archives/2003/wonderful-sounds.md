<p>Are you tired? Do you need a holiday? Then head on over to <a href="http://www.quietamerican.org/vacation.html">quietamerican.org</a>, and go on a one-minute vacation. Every Monday, Aaron Ximm uploads a 60 second recording of somewhere in the world. Put on a good pair of headphones, sit back with a glass of wine and let yourself drift off somewhere.</p>

<p>The recordings are absolutely wonderful. There's everything from <a href="http://www.quietamerican.org/download/other/antarctica.mp3">a woman singing in an oil drum</a> in Antarctica, the sound of the London Underground (<a href="http://www.quietamerican.org/download/other/tube.mp3">Northern Line</a>) and the gentle boom  of the <a href="http://www.quietamerican.org/download/other/Ahrenshoop.mp3">Baltic Sea at Ahreshoop</a>. I could listen to these recordings for hours.</p>

<p>The Antarctic recording is particularly haunting, and reminds me of an occasion several years ago when I was tagging along with a small group being shown around the <a href="http://web.kyoto-inet.or.jp/org/orion/eng/hst/romanesq/pisa.html">Duomo in Pisa</a>, Italy. The tour guide was describing the perfect acoustics; if you know what you are doing, the echoes allow you to sing a harmony with yourself. He started to demonstrate and the beautiful notes cascaded down on us. It was all I could do to stop myself from crying. The Ahrenshoop recording is gorgeous too. I could quite easily fall asleep to it playing on a loop.</p>
