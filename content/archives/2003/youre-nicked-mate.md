<p><a href="http://www.studio2f.com/stolen/">This (studio2f)</a> rather puts my <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/elementary-my-dear-watson">recent</a> adventures with a bandwidth rustler in the shade. The cheek of the man! At least I don't have to make my living out of what I post on the web, so net thieves are a personal irritation rather than a drain on my income.</p>
