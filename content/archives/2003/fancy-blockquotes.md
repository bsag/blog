<p>There's a great series of tutorials over at <a href="http://simon.incutio.com">Simon Willison's Weblog</a>, and in particular, a very handy hint about <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2003/05/21/stylingBlockquotes" title="Styling blockquotes with CSS">styling blockquotes</a> with dinky little background images. I've been thinking about doing something a bit more interesting with my blockquotes, but I couldn't decide exactly what to do with them. This might be a neat solution.</p>
