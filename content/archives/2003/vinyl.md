<p>The parents visited today, so we did the usual thing of visiting colleges, wandering around shops and drinking coffee. I made the mistake (from my mum's perspective, anyway) of introducing my dad to Avid Records--a fantastic second-hand vinyl shop. They have acres of rock, pop and blues on the ground floor, but it was only recently that I discovered they also have a first floor (up the narrow stairs, taking care not to kick off the piles of records stacked there) which has thousands of folk and classical records.</p>

<p>As I've <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/blog/archives/000002.html">mentioned before</a>, I---together with my dad and brother---am a music and hi-fi geek. But I've never got in to vinyl, and consequently don't have a turntable. This might be something I have to change, if only because you can feed a music habit so much more cheaply. Most of the records in Avid (apart from the very rare pressings) are around &pound;1.50 each. You don't need to be a mathematician to work out how many more recordings you can get for the price of one CD. Well OK, I had to get my calculator out, but then I'm mathemophobic. The simple answer is <em>lots</em>. I think I'm going to have to ask my brother to make me a turntable<sup>1</sup>. My dad was like a kid in a sweet shop, and kept marvelling at the great condition of the records. He said that the next time he visits, he'll bring a huge box to take home a stack of discs.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> He designs and builds turntables as a hobby from time to time, and they look and sound great!</p>
