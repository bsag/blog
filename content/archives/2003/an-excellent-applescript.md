<p>When people post a comment on this site and list a URL, I often visit out of curiosity. OK, I'm nosy--I can't help it. Sometimes it takes a while to get around to looking, now that my blogroll is reaching unmanagable proportions. Anyway, that was how I came upon <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/pete.boardman/weblog/2003/06/23/index.html#mailsmith">this absolute gem</a> of an Applescript, on <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/pete.boardman/weblog/">Pete Boardman's weblog</a>.</p>

<p>I was slightly missing the feature in Apple Mail which displays the number of unread mails in the Dock icon, but this is even better. It uses <a href="http://projects.tynsoe.org/fr/geektool/">GeekTool</a> to display the name of each mailbox with unread mail, and the number of unread mails in each box. I have it set up to display in the bottom right corner of my desktop, so that it's always visible. It's fantastic--if I don't happen to be on <a href="http://www.codetek.com/php/virtual.php">VirtualDesktop 3</a> (which is where Mailsmith lives), and Mailsmith goes 'ting' to tell me new mail has arrived, I can see if it's likely to be worth switching desktops for, or if it's from the work mail-list, which is rarely worth switching back for.</p>
