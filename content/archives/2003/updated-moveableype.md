<p>Thanks to a comment by <a href="http://www.fuddland.org.uk/blog/" title="fuddland">dvd</a> yesterday, I found out that <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/news/2003_02.shtml#000782" title="Movabletype">Movabletype</a> had been updated to 2.6. I backed up my entries (just in case), installed, ran the update script, and all went sweetly. There are some nice improvements, most notably support for text formatting plugins. Brad Choate has already produced one called <a href="http://www.bradchoate.com/past/mttextile.php" title="MT-Textile plugin">MT-Textile</a>, which is inspired by an online text processing service written by <a href="http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/" title="Textile">Dean Allen</a>. It formats block text into paragraphs, headings and lists, does inline text formatting such as emphasis and strong, and converts difficult characters to proper HTML entities. It seems to work very nicely, barring a few minor bugs.</p>

<p>In order to get round one of these bugs (text remaining formatted in the auto-generated excerpts which go in the <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/blog/index.rdf">RSS feed</a>, I have now included the whole of the entry body (but not the extended text) in the RSS feed. This is probably more sensible anyway, as it gives you a better idea what the post is about, and doesn't cut off your reading experience rudely mid-sentence.</p>
