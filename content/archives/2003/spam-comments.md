<p>I've been somewhat plagued by a deluge of spam comments on the site recently, so I was very interested in <a href="http://www.mentalized.net/journal/2003/09/09/movable_type_easier_editremoval_of_new_comments/">this hack</a> to delete a spam comment directly from the email notification. I agree with <a href="http://nslog.com/archives/2003/10/09/easy_comment_deletion.php">Erik</a> though--a direct link to also rebuild the site and add the offending IP to the banned list would be just perfect.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any clever strategies for dealing with this kind of thing? I check my email fairly frequently, but I find it irritating to have to immediately wade through several pages of options to get rid of some objectionable comment so that I'm not inadvertently promoting a p0rn site. On the other hand, I really don't want to turn commenting off, because I think that the comments are the best part of writing my blog. Sure, I get the occasional troll visiting along with the spammers, but the majority of comments are funny, informative, interesting or thought-provoking. Or in exceptional cases, all of the above. All I want is a painless way to get rid of the 2% of abusive comments.</p>
