<p>We've been watching Monty Don on 'Gardener's World' tonight. As Mr. Bsag knows all about <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/montys-back/" title="Monty's back">my fondness for Monty</a>, he keeps teasing me with <em>double entendres</em> of an almost <a href="http://www.carryonline.com/" title="Carry Online">Carry On film</a> championship standard.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<p>"Ooo, look at the size of his dibber."</p>
<p>"He's got a nice fat marrow there."</p>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And so on... The trouble is that <em>double entendres</em> are a bit like Pringles &mdash; once you pop, you can't stop. Oo-er.</p>
