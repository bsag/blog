<p>Mr. Bsag was trying to remember the proper term for baby hamsters this evening (I forget why), and--embarrassingly given my profession--I couldn't remember either. We hit Google for an answer, and in the course of our search, found the World's Cutest Hamster Picture <a href="http://www.hamsterific.com/Hamsterpics/FNF/Black-Pearl.jpg">here</a>. This little smasher is a Djungarian hamster (<em>Phodopus campbelli</em>, also erroneously known as a Siberian hamster--"Ee's no rat! Ee's 'amstair!"). The males of this species show extremely unusual behaviour for mammals; they <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/720421.stm">act as midwives to the females</a>, pulling the babies gently out of the birth canal, and cleaning off the placenta to clear their airways.</p>

<p>The term is 'pups', by the way, just in case you are on tenterhooks. Obvious, really.</p>
