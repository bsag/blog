<p>I've got a filthy cold at the moment, and I feel as if my swollen sinuses are pressing on my brain. Sinus-induced temporary brain damage can be the only possible excuse for the unreasonable amount of amusement that I've derived from <a href="http://www.ducktapeclub.com/contests/roll/lyrics.asp?entryid=131">this simple song</a> in praise of very sticky, very strong household tape.</p>
