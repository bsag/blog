<p>"<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/animals/mammals/" title="Life of Mammals">The Life of Mammals</a>" has been a consistently great series: wonderful photography, innovative discoveries of animal behaviour, and sparing &mdash; but highly effective &mdash; use of <span class="caps">CGI</span>. I thought the sequence in yesterday's program where David Attenborough stood inside the skeleton of a blue whale, while the internal organs were built around him, was superb. There are some things that you just couldn't do any other way, and it seems to me that getting an idea of the sheer titanic scale of the blue whale (heart the size of a small family car, 10 tonnes of blood) is one of those things.</p>
