<p>You are all probably thoroughly fed-up with me <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/blog/archives/000249.html">wittering</a> on <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/blog/archives/000118.html">about</a> <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/blog/archives/000084.html">Radio 4</a>, but I had to note the special feature about the station in the Radio Times. There's a picture of Stephen Fry on the front &mdash; looking blissful &mdash; with the quote, "It turns me on". Indeed.</p>

<p>It's certainly a national treasure. There are a few duffers of course, but the overall quality of the output is astounding. Recently, Radio 4 has also commissioned a great deal of new writing, which is very encouraging. The diversity of subjects is huge, and I've frequently looked at the listings to find a completely unexpected topic, which turns out to be riveting. Where else would you hear a series of short documentaries about a Bee Inspector*. The feature in the Radio Times also lists some upcoming programmes in the same vein: 'Forgotten Female Fossilists' and 'The Secret Life of Car Parks'.</p>

<p>I'm not the only one enthusing about Radio 4 at the moment: <a href="http://fuddland.org.uk/archives/2003/06/09/001801_pipe_and_slippers_time.php" title="fuddland">dvd</a> has been singing the praises of 'I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue', and Tom Coates at Plasticbag.org is a <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2003/06/in_love_with_radio_4.shtml" title="http://www.plasticbag.org">recent convert</a>.</p>

<p>* If only I had known that such a job existed when I was choosing a career. I can say with confidence that my school careers room didn't have any information about Bee Inspecting.</p>
