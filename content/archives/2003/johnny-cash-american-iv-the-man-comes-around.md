I do<p>n't really like country music. That is, I don't really like country music as a genre -- I do like some <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/steve-earle-jerusalem">country artists (Steve Earle - Jerusalem)</a> as individuals. 'The Man Comes Around' is an interesting album of some original tracks and some covers, performed in Johnny's inimitable style -- and now rather ageing  voice. Some tracks I love, and some I hate (nothing can make me like "We'll meet again" -- the Vera Lynn song).</p>

<p>The stand out track for me is "Hurt". It's a really bitter song about loss and regret and disappointment. The video suggests that Johnny sees a religious theme in it too, but you can read it either way. This is where his ageing voice comes into its own: when he sings,</p>

<blockquote>
"I hurt myself today to see if I still feel"
 and "Everyone I know goes away in the end"
</blockquote>

<p>you can tell that he really knows what that means. It's a very powerful song. "Personal Jesus" is also great. If you'd told me that Johnny Cash singing a Depeche Mode song would be good, I would probably have told you that you were mad, but it just works somehow. It's certainly an interesting album, and one that is somewhat different to my usual listening. Sometimes a change is as good as a rest...</p>
