<p>I noticed something a bit odd about my referrer logs the other day. In the statistics for visitors' domains, guess which country with a known domain comes sixth in the list of most frequent visitors? Go on, have a go.</p>

<p>Give up? Well, I'll tell you--it's everyone's favourite volcanic Caribbean island,  <a href="http://www.mvo.ms/">Montserrat</a>. So after .com, .net, .uk, .ca and .edu, .ms is right up there with the big domains. The domain sucks down a lot of pages, but very little bandwidth, so I have no idea what that means. My guess is that it's some Montserratian robot or spider, but I would love to think that I had some real, live Montserratian readers; one eye on the screen and the other on the active volcano, I would imagine.</p>
