<p><a href="http://www.moveabletype.org/">Moveabletype 2.6.3</a> is out. Actually, it's been out a couple of days, but I've been too busy to install it. But after the odd problem I had <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/breakdown">yesterday </a> I decided that it would probably be a good time to sort it out. It all seemed to go OK &mdash; but as  usual &mdash; if you spot anything untoward, let me know.</p>

<p>I also decided to add a line to the popup comments template to remind people about URL fomatting. URLs are automatically converted, but you have to leave a space after the URL and before any other characters or punctuation. I toyed with turning on HTML in the comments, but then you lose auto-formatting of URLs. Swings and roundabouts...</p>
