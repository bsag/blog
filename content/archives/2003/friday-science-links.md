<p>I'm a bit late with this one (what the hell &mdash; the human genome has been around a few million years I'm sure it can wait a bit longer), but the <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993621" title="New Scientist: Human Genome Project">final sequence</a> of the human genome project has been produced. I read one of the most lucid and well-argued accounts of what this all means (or rather doesn't) at <a href="http://www.idlewords.com/weblog.04.2003.html#153">Idlewords</a>: and he's not even a biologist! It's well worth a read.</p>

<p>Apparently, if women have a wider computer screen, they match mens' performance on navigation around <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993628" title="New Scientist: Women and widescreen">simulated 3D environments</a>. This is just the kind of <del>excuse</del> hard data I've been looking for to justify the purchase of an <a href="http://www.apple.com/displays/acd23/">Apple 23 inch Cinema Display</a>.</p>
