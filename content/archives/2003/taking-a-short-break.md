<p>It's got to that time of year when I need to take a break from work, or I'll explode or something. So I'm going to take abdicate all responsibility and take a few days off. I won't be posting until the end of next week. With any luck, I'll return rested, enthused and bursting with health and well-being. That's the plan, anyway.</p>
