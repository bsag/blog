<p>And I thought <em>I</em> was a geekâ¦ This guy has <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/cmiller/diary.html?start=56" title="Diary for cmiller">hacked âfloatbg'</a>, a background changer for X, so that the colour gives some cues to the time of day. This was because he was spending so much time in his windowless loft that his circadian clock got completely randomised. He puts it much better than I could: </p>

<blockquote>"It was easier than hacking my  medulla oblongata.  I <em>hate</em> hardware."</blockquote>

<p>You know, sometimes I look at the <a href="http://www.glu.com/products/weatherpop/index.html" title="WeatherPop">weather</a> on my menubar and think, "It's snowing? [actually looks out window] Oh. So it is." But hey, I know what time it is. I have a clock on my menubar too.</p>
