<p><a href="http://greynotebook.typepad.com/grey/2003/07/posting_from_ti.html"  title="08#: The Grey Notebook">JB</a> and <a href="http://www.whiterabbits.com/MacNetJournal/#note_1470"  title="MacNetJournal">MacNetJournal</a> mentioned that a new version of <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/Tinderbox2.html"  title="Tinderbox 2.0">Tinderbox</a> was out (version 2.0), which has a load of new features. Naturally, I raced to download it, and I must say that I'm very impressed! If this post makes it to you, the shiny new direct-weblog-posting-thingy (I'm sure Eastgate have a better name for it) works; you can post your notes directly to MoveableType, Radio Userland or Blogger. No more dragging and dropping! It will even fetch your recent posts with a single command. It's all rather slick, and seems to have a huge speed boost over the previous version.</p>
