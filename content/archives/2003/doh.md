<p>You know how some women who get beaten-up by their partners claim that they have walked into a door? Well I actually do walk into doors. I managed to clout my arm on the door handle in our living room yesterday morning. It was early, I only had a few neurons firing, and they evidently hadn't got their act together yet. My brain failed to center my body on the door opening, with the inevitable result of a painful impact between arm and metal door handle.</p>
