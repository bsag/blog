<p>I came across <a href="http://28mm.org/">this (28 mm)</a> wonderful photography magazine the other day. The images are pretty varied, but really stunning. I love the <a href="http://28mm.org/gallery.php?artist=roncillizza&amp;issue=3">Paper Birch</a> images for delicate beauty, and the <a href="http://28mm.org/gallery.php?artist=roncillizza&amp;issue=3">Mall-aise</a> pictures for gritty, funny, sad commentary on modern life and materialism.</p>
