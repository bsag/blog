<p>John Gruber of Daring Fireball has just released a new version of his excellent <a href="http://www.moveabletype.org" title="Moveabletype">Moveabletype</a> plugin, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/" title="SmartyPants 1.1">SmartyPants</a>. It's a clever little utility which 'educates' your quotes, en-dashes, em-dashes and elipses, and encodes them as proper HTML entities. I'm using them here, if anyone has noticed...</p>
