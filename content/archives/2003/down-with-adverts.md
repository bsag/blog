<p>I've <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/harry-potter/" title="Harry Potter">written before</a> about the brain-melting tedium of adverts in the cinema. Now it looks as if the punters are starting to strike back. Film-goers in the States are <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-film19.html" title="Chicago Sun Times">suing chains of cinemas</a> for damages for advertising a certain start time and then showing three or four minutes of adverts before the film itself. Good for them, I say, though I think that they are getting away lightly with only four minutes â it seems like we have to endure about 15 minutes when we venture to the <a href="http://www.odeon.co.uk/" title="Odeon cinemas">Odeon</a> cinema in Oxford. At least when you're watching TV at home, you can always mute the adverts, channel-hop, or go and make a coffee. In the cinema, you're a captive audience, and you can only roll your eyes and groan as yet another flaming Bacardi advert comes on.</p>
