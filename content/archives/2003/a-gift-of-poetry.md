<p>Like many women, I have occasional bouts of gloomy dissatisfaction with the shape of my body. Some of this is due to a slight insecurity, and some to utter frustration with the manufacturers of women's clothing, who seem to think that women are basically cylindrical like men. Mr. Bsag--who is always telling me that <em>proper women</em> are supposed to be my shape--found the perfect poem for me; it's called <a href="http://www.geocities.com/womenpoets/clifton.html">A Homage to My Hips</a>, and is by Lucille Clifton. I can't imagine a nicer gift--the poem is a wonderful celebration of the body. I found <a href="http://www.poets.org/poems/poems.cfm?prmID=1459">a page</a> on which you're supposed to be able to listen to Lucille reading her poem, but I didn't have any luck with the RealOne audio file. That's a shame, as I'd love to hear her reading it.</p>

<p>I'm going to copy it out and pin it up beside the mirror to remind myself to be proud of my shape.</p>
