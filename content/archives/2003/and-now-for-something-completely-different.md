<p>Slipping smoothly from something very serious to something utterly trivial, I've been tinkering with my templates again. First, I've <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/" title="SmartyPants">SmartyPant-ized</a> the comments and trackback listings, so quotes (double and single), apostrophes, ellipses, en-dashes and em-dashes should all be properly encoded for your commenting pleasure. Second, I've reversed the display order of comments, so that they appear with the oldest first. This is much more logical to read if people are following a thread of a discussion down the page. Actually, this is the default in a new installation of <a href="http://www.moveabletype.org" title="Moveabletype">Moveabletype</a>, and I can't for the life of me remember what possessed me to change it.</p>
