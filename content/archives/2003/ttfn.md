<p>This is likely to be my last regular post for a couple of weeks. On Monday I'm off to Florida -- the land of Disney and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,903312,00.html">spam barons</a> for a conference and then a little bit of R&amp;R&amp;SWM*. I'll be writing about my experiences as usual offline, and if I do get a chance to connect I'll upload a load of posts at one time. I've applied for a T-Mobile wireless account, so if I find a hotspot Starbucks, I'll be a happy little geek bunny. In the meantime, have fun without me and keep commenting...</p>
