<p>I've had to get the bus into the work for the past couple of weeks[2], so I've been spending quite a lot of time with some of the hordes of language school students currently tooling around in Oxford. This tends to slow the journey into work a bit, as it takes some time for the driver to ascertain where they want to go and show them how to use the machine for passes. He had a brave attempt at making up the lost time by engaging Warp Factor 9 between the stops. With so many people standing, this was <em>interesting</em>, to say the least; I don't think I've seen so many white knuckles outside of a theme park.</p>

<p>I'm always puzzled about why the people who organize these summer schools think it's a good idea to hand out identical backpacks, t-shirts or caps to the students. It seems an absolute invitation for local ne'er-do-wells to target them as potential crime victims. In fact, I'm sure I remember some discussion of this very point a couple of years ago in the local paper, after a spate of muggings on the students.</p>

<p>Some of the students even have laminated ID badges hanging around their necks. These might as well have the following message written on them in large, clear type:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hello. I'm not from your country. Consequently, I'm not (as yet!) very proficient with your language, nor am I familiar with your customs, your law enforcement officers, or your public transport system. Might I therefore suggest that if you are contemplating a mugging, pick-pocketing or a confidence trick of some kind, I would make an easy and convenient recipient of your professional attentions. Thank you for your kind attention.</p></blockquote>

<p>[2] When I went to ride my bike for the first time after <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/casualty/">my accident</a>, I found that the back wheel was really buckled, so it's been in the repair shop since then. Apparently 24" wheels aren't easy to come by.</p>
