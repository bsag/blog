<p>So, it has been confirmed: <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/delivery.cfm/delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID415043_code030617590.pdf?abstractid=415043" title="The Price of Man and Woman">women are valued less than men</a>, even when they are virtual men and women. Edward Castronova has done a rather clever study on the prices which EverQuest avatars (a computer generated body with skills and assets) fetch in online auctions. Female avatars fetch 12 to 16.5% less than male avatars with comparable skills. Given the fact that female avatars only make up 20% of the population, you would think that rarity might give them more value, if nothing else. It's also odd that scantily clad female avatars feature quite heavily on the <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/">official EverQuest site</a>. This is pretty depressing. Has Buffy taught men nothing?</p>
