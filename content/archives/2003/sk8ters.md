<p>Mr. Bsag and I went to London today to visit the Royal Academy Summer show (more on that story later<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>). On our way back on the Oxford Tube, we saw half a dozen inline skaters weaving around <a href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?X=528000&Y=180000&width=500&height=300&client=public&gride=528546&gridn=179994&keepicon=true&coordsys=gb&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&up.x=20&up.y=6&scale=10000">Park Lane</a>, looking like toreadors taunting the taxis and buses, touching the cars then sweeping away. They must do it for the adrenaline buzz &mdash; I don't fancy even driving a car around that chaotic race track.</p>
