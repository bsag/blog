<p>While watching the Stephen Fry comedy quiz "QI" last night, a rather striking question came up:</p>

<p><em>"Which has been responsible for the most human deaths--the nuclear bomb, or ducks?"</em></p>

<p>Of course, phrased like that, it was fairly obvious what answer they were looking for, and it was not going to be the obvious one. But I was still rather surprised; ducks, it seems were the primary vectors of the <a href="http://www.ninthday.com/spanish_flu.htm">Spanish 'flu pandemic</a> in 1918-1919, which is thought to have killed around 30 million people worldwide.</p>

<p>So, the moral of this story is that you should stay away from ducks. If they're not <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/about-the-time-i-was-mugged-by-a-duck/">mugging you</a>, they're giving you 'flu.</p>
