<p>I caught a classic bit of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/">Today programme</a> this morning. They had Falim Khoury (the head barman at the Savoy Hotel) shaking cocktails for everyone, and it was fairly evident from the general level of merriment that a certain amount of actual drinking was going on. Poor Charlotte Green had to try to read the news with sounds of shaking cocktails in the background, and she got a serious case of the giggles. The cocktail in question was a 'Corpse Reviver' &mdash; she evidently needed an anti-corpse reviver to stop her <a href="http://www.anecdotage.com/index.php?aid=6112" title="Definition of the term corpsing">corpsing</a>. In the end, she had to wheeze, "Stop it, Jim!". I assume that he was making faces at her and making it even worse.</p>

<p>Even if you didn't start your celebrations quite that early, have a good time tonight, and I hope that you do a lot of giggling.</p>
