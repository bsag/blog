<p>Given my <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/blog/archives/000451.html">continuing obsession</a> with finding the perfect note-taking/outliner application, I was very interested to read <a href="http://www.atpm.com/9.10/atpo.shtml">this article</a> covering the features and capabilities of a huge range of outliners. The article was interesting because--rather than exhaustively covering all of the features that the different applications offer--it discussed what you might want an outliner to do, and then briefly mentioned which of the programmes would best fulfil those needs.</p>

<p>For me, this addresses one of the most difficult things about choosing an outliner or note-taker; everyone has different priorities and needs from it, so no application is going to be perfect for everyone all of the time. Some people need a digital equivalent of the scraps of paper and backs of envelopes that we all use; in other words, somewhere to quickly capture some vital bit of information and then easily find it later. Others need a more formal place to collect bits of related information together and perhaps form the starting point for a traditional document. Sometimes you want a less linear representation of your ideas--an area in which <a href="http://eastgate.com/Tinderbox">Tinderbox</a> excels.</p>

<p>This is the essence of why--despite owning several excellent outliners and note-takers--I'm still trying out new ones. At different times I need different things, and I'm still trying to reach the nirvana that the digital age once offered: the paperless office.</p>
