<p>Fruit bowls are strange things. I'm quite a keen fruit consumer, but however much I eat, there always seem to be one or two pieces of fruit which decompose quietly at the bottom of the bowl. Today I discovered an ominous looking kiwi fruit lurking at the bottom, and gingerly picked it up. It squished in a worrying way, and then actually fizzed. It sounded like an alka-seltzer dropped in water--that's a serious level of fermentation. For a mercifully brief moment, I toyed with the idea of drinking the juice to see if it had produced a decent kiwi hooch. A particularly painful memory of some banana wine I once tasted surfaced just in time, and I threw the fruit in the bin. A luck escape, I think.</p>
