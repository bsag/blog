<p>I know that this is the second link I've posted recently to a photography site, but I came upon this one via <a href="http://www.zeldman.com" title="Jeffrey Zeldman Presents">Zeldman</a>, and I just had to share it because the images are so extraordinary: <a href="http://www.lostamerica.com/lostframe.html" title="Lost America">Lost America Night Photography</a>. The pictures are all taken around the full moon on a really long exposure. The colours make the abandoned diners and gas stations look totally other-worldly. I'm really excited waiting the next full moon now, as I'm going to dash out with a camera, a tripod and a lot of patience, and give it a go.</p>
