<p>I quite like 'Biologist', but occasionally I wish that I had a more interesting job title. I think I've just found the ultimate. On <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2003/03_march/26/challenge_professionals.shtml">University Challenge</a> yesterday, one of the contestants in the <a href="http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/">College of Arms</a> team was a Mr. Cheesman, who is 'Rouge Dragon Pursuivant'. Imagine how cool that title would look on your passport...</p>

<p><a href="http://12.1911encyclopedia.org/P/PU/PURSUIVANT.htm" title="1911 Edition Encyclopedia">Apparently</a>, the other three Pursuivants are 'Rouge Croix', 'Bluemantle' and 'Portcullis', but I think 'Rouge Dragon' is the coolest.</p>
