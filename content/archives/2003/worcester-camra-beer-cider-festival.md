<p>We've just got back from <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/blog/archives/000008.html">another beer festival</a> this time in Worcester, held on the race course. Once again, I seized the rare opportunity to taste a number of ciders and perries[1], and had some really fine ones. The problem with cider at a beer festival is that &mdash; at 6-7% alcohol by volume &mdash; you can't have too many before you feel so mellow that you can only sit in the sun with a daft grin on your face, unable to summon the energy to go back to the bar.</p>

<p>Real ale brewers always seem to come up with great names for their brews, which often just seem designed to embarrass the person ordering at the bar. Here are a few of my favourites (with the brewery in parentheses):</p>

<ul>
<li>Wish Ewe Were Here (Dent)</li>
<li>Strip And At It (Freeminer)</li>
<li>Thrappledouser (Inveralmond)</li>
<li>That (Teme Valley)</li>
<li>Piddle In The Sun (Wyre Piddle)</li>
<li>I Can't Believe It's Not Bitter (Oakleaf)</li>
<li>Weiss Squad (Fyfe)</li>
<li>Cohen the Barbarian (Oakham--they must be Pratchett fans)</li>
</ul>

<p>I ask you &mdash; what could be finer than sitting in the sun on a race course, a cool breeze blowing, a brass band playing a James Bond medley and sipping a nice hand-crafted beer or cider?</p>

<p>[1] The festival guide helpfully provided this description of perry: "Perry is just like cider but every apple is a pear."</p>
