<p>This article really made me laugh---peering over your fellow Mac user's shoulder to <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2003/09/30/dock.html">see what he or she has in their Dock</a>---it's so me! I even look at the screenshots in MacUser magazine carefully in case I might be missing something. I'm also glad to see that I'm in good company with my right-side pinned Dock. It's the only place to have it, dontcha know.</p>
