<p>...no! It's <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3112095.stm" title="BBC News">Ultra-Fast Flying Squirrel Man!</a> Felix Baumgartner jumped out of a plane 30,000 feet over Dover early this morning, then glided at about 135 mph across the English Channel, to land safely in Calais. He used a small carbon fibre wing strapped to his back to turn a plummet straight down into a slightly more controlled glide.</p><p>Logically, I know that you are travelling pretty fast when you're skydiving, but it really brings it home to you when someone is skydiving horizontally. Felix crossed the Channel in only 14 minutes. Beats taking the ferry, I suppose.</p>
