<p>There's an <a href="http://www.macnet2.com/more.php?id=366_0_1_0_M" title="MacNETv2">interesting article</a> by John Manzione on his experiences of running the developer release of Panther. He likes it so much he keeps reinstalling it, despite the inevitable stability problems and bugs. I'm certainly looking forward to the final version. I think that I'm mostly waiting for that first sweet moment when I casually demonstrate Expos&eacute; to a Windows user.</p>
