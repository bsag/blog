<p>Regular readers may <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/farscape">remember</a> my addiction to the excellent <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/farscape/" title="BBC Farscape site">Farscape</a> &mdash; well now it's all over. I watched my recording of the last (probably last ever) episode earlier in the week, but I was so overcome by gloom at never seeing another new episode that it's only now that I feel ready to write about it.</p>

<p>The last one was a total and utter classic in the Farscape mould. I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't watched it yet, but regular viewers will know that if it looks as if there'll be a happy ending, it's a sure sign that something really dreadful is about to happen. Everything looked like it was coming together and then everything fell apart.</p>

<p>Oh, I'll miss it so much. Farscape has been an oasis of intelligent, funny, shocking, innovative and truly wonderful viewing for 4 years or so. In tribute, I'll carry on swearing Farscape style and referring to popcorn as 'copporn' (Rygel never did quite get to grips with English). I like to think that it's marginally less geeky than speaking Klingon, but I might be deluding myself.</p>
