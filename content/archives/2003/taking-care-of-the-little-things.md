<p><img src="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/blog/archives/images/highlights.jpg" alt="Screengrab of highlighting in Mailsmith" height="90" width="192" align="left" border="1" hspace="10" vspace="10" />Two days ago, <a href="http://www.barebones.com/support/mailsmith/updates.shtml">Bare Bones Software</a> updated my new <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/mailsmith-20/">favourite email application</a>--Mailsmith--to version 2.0.1. As ever, there were what seemed like thousands of improvements and fixes listed, so I just scanned over the first few. When I fired up the update, I immediately noticed one improvement which had been very subtly bothering me in 2.0. When you highlight an item in the mail list which has a coloured label applied, the labelling is now shown in all its glory, as you can see in the screen capture above. It's beautifully done, giving you the best of both worlds; you can see that the item is highlighted, and you can clearly see the label in the most important fields (the subject of the mail and the label).</p>

<p>I find myself using the labels more and more in Mailsmith. As you can see, you can give a custom name to labels, filter using labels as a criterion, or execute an action with an Applescript. So, using a script produced by <a href="http://www.mostrom.pp.se/info/ms/scripts/scr0015.html">Jan Erik Mostrom</a>, I have a script that moves emails labelled 'Priority1', 'Priority2' or 'Priority3' to my 'ToDo' mailbox, and those labelled 'Follow up' to my (yes, you've guessed it) 'Follow up' mailbox. It's a very quick and easy way of sorting the wheat from the chaff in a packed inbox, and the coloured labels help you quickly see what needs to be dealt with first.</p>
