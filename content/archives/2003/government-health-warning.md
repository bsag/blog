<p>Forget about <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3251828.stm">banning drivers from using mobile phones</a> without a hands-free set while driving--listening to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/clue.shtml">I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue</a> while driving ought to be illegal. I'm not sure if there was more water on the windscreen or in my eyes while <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/clue/article/barry.shtml">Barry Cryer</a> gave an unbelievable rendition of the Beach Boy's 'Barbara Anne' to the tune of a Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto. A close second was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/clue/article/graeme.shtml">Graeme Garden's</a> rendering of the lyrics of 'A Windmill in Old Amsterdam' to the tune of 'Mr. Tambourine Man' by Bob Dylan, which was scarily plausible.</p>

<p>ISIHAC is a national treasure which should have listed status. When I'm feeling as low and as stressed as I am at the moment--as if I'm trying to run up a very long 'down' escalator--it's one of the few things that can completely pick me up and make me forget about everything I've got to do. But make sure you practise safe driving--don't laugh and drive!</p>
