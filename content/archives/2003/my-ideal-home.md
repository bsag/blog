<p>This <a href="http://www.themushroomhouse.com/ is completely wonderful">house</a>--it would suit me perfectly. Ever since I was little, I've wanted to live in a tree. This house isn't a tree, exactly, but it looks like one in all the important ways. And I love the fact that there isn't a straight line in the place. The bendy balustrades and curvy mosaics reminded me a bit of the work of <a href="http://www.greatbuildings.com/architects/Antonio_Gaudi.html">Gaudi</a>. I look a bit like a hobbit, so why not live in a hobbit house? The Mushroom House if for sale, but there's no price guide given--if you have to ask, you can't afford it, I expect.</p>

<p>While I'm on the subject, I've noticed a very marked cultural difference between the UK and North America in how Estate Agents/Realtors present themselves. When travelling in the States, it seemed as if every advertisement for a Realtor had to sport a huge photo of the owner of the company, grinning inanely and trying to look trustworthy. I've never seen the same kind of advertising in the UK. This probably says something about the social standing (or lack of it) of the profession in the UK--they probably worry about people <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/blog/archives/000491.html">hunting them down</a> with pointy things.</p>
