<p>I've installed MacOSX 10.2.4, iPhoto 2, iMove 3, and Quicktime 6.1 today. Although I've rarely had any problems with updates, I backed up the disc fully, and quit any applications that might try any funny stuff during the installation. Then I waited, watching the chasing arrows and muttering imprecations to the gods of software. Thankfully, it all went fine. Everything that used to work still seems to work, and there's the usual post-install speed bump. Yay! My laptop is my only work machine, so any problems result in great tearing-out of hair and gnashing of teeth.</p>
