<p>[Tuesday 18th March]</p>

<p>Even though I understand how it works, flight always amazes me. When you're sitting in a 747, thundering down the runway, it's always something of a surprise when the thing gets off the ground. Like a magic trick, knowing how it works just impresses you more. Mind you, taking off is the easy bit -- all you have to do is balance a few tonnes of aeroplane on the rear wheels to get a bit of a draft under the wings, get up to 330 mph, and hey presto, you're airborne. Or so I'm told -- I've never tried it myself. No, the real skill is in landing. I should say that the real skill is in landing <em>safely</em> -- gravity tends to take care of the getting to the ground thing without any intervention.</p>

<p>The best bit about flying is seeing great landscapes from the air. This trip wasn't particularly spectacular in that respect, but on a flight to San Diego, I spent most of the trip with my face pressed to the window, marvelling everything below. There were glaciers, terminal morraines and drumlins galore -- it was the whole of my physical geography A-level laid out before me, but would have been a lot more useful <em>before</em> my A-level.</p>
