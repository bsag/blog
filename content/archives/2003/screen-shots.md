<p>I'm a bit nervous about owning up to this, in case I find that it <em>is</em> just me, but... </p>

<p>Does anyone else find that &mdash; when loading up a screenshot in a browser which opens in its own window &mdash; you try to click the close widgets in the <em>image</em> rather than the real window widgets? This happens to me all the time. I'm sitting there scowling while clicking away fruitlessly, muttering "Stoopid close button" in a Homeric<sup>1</sup> fashion, before I realize my mistake. Then I glance around to check whether anyone saw me being such a muppet.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>Simpson, obviously.</p>
