<p>I don't know, it's like buses &mdash; you wait years for a <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/blog/archives/000357.html">decent writing environment</a> to come along, and then several are in development at the same time. Matt Gemmell at <a href="http://www.scotlandsoftware.com/blog/index.php/dev/treatise/treatise.html">Irate Scotsman</a> has proposed a writing editor with the provisional name of 'Treatise'. There's a UI mock-up <a href="http://www.scotlandsoftware.com/blog/index.php/dev/treatise/treatise_ui_mockup.html">here</a>. It seems to have all the proposed features I was looking for, as did the project <a href="http://laddonline.com/">Nathan mentioned</a> that he was thinking of pursuing (in the comments on the entry <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/blog/archives/000357.html">I wrote in July</a> on this subject). It will be really interesting to see what develops. Sorry &mdash; no pun intended there.</p>
