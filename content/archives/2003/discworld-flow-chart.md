<p>I love Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels so I was delighted by this <a href="http://www.ie.lspace.org/books/reading-order-guides/the-discworld-reading-order-guide-colour-v1-1.gif">flow chart</a> with information on the optimal reading order, and the temporal and character links between the books. Looking at the map, I realize that I've read almost all of the books. I must <strong>really</strong> be a fan.</p>
