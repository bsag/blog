<p>Vim just gets more and more amazing. I was looking around for a free touch typing tutorial program, just to refresh my skills a bit and practice on the new keyboard. I found a plugin for Vim called <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=461">TTCoach</a>, written by Mikolaj Machowski which does just that. You can start at any level and it measures your speed, accuracy, and logs the percentage of errors produced by each finger and each letter, which is pretty useful. It can even display a little ASCII representation of your keyboard, where the 'keys' are highlighted when you hit them, so that you have visual feedback without having to look at the real keyboard.</p>
