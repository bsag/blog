<p>I don't--as a general rule--watch or listen to programmes about money or personal finance. I just find it too depressing, and if I'm brutally honest, rather dull. But last night I watched a Money Programme investigation called "Mortgage Madness", and ended up totally fuming by the end. I haven't yet descended to the middle class depths of boring the pants off people with in-depth discussion of interest rates and house prices, but it is one of the subjects most likely to send me off on a long rant.</p>

<p>You see, the house prices in Oxford have reached ridiculous levels. Prices have risen all over the UK, but many people use Oxford as a convenient commutable suburb of London (rather them than me--you wouldn't catch me spending 90% of my life on the M40), forcing the prices up even more. If you didn't buy a house at the depths of the last slump, or you don't earn 50K a year, you don't have a hope. Or so I thought.</p>

<p>The programme uncovered mortgage brokers <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3222053.stm">encouraging people to lie</a> about their income on mortgage applications. New 'self-certification' mortgages allow people to apply without supplying any pay slips. The system just depends on people claiming that they earn 40K a year--honest, guv! Brokers encourage people to lie so that they can borrow up to 6 times their salary, rather than the more usual 3.5 multiple, whereupon the brokers land a nice fat commission. It is entirely possible that the reason the housing market has continued to rise--with no visible means of support--is because lots of people have been borrowing well beyond their means. As people get bigger and bigger mortgages, prices go up, so people borrow more and more money, <em>ad infinitum</em>. And the banks, brokers and mortgage advisers get wealthier and wealthier.</p>

<p>Of course, the moment interest rates go up (even slightly), or prices drop, a lot of people are going to be up to their over-mortgaged necks in debt, and having their houses repossessed faster than you can say "endowment", but the bankers will be laughing their big fat heads off. Bastards.</p>
