<p>There's a huge amount of building work going on at work, so the toilets have been swapped around so that no-one has to dash up or down three flights of stairs when nature calls. The upshot of all this is that my nearest toilet is a former gent's toilet. Walking in there is a bit of an odd experience, even once you've got over the "Oh, wrong toilets!" feeling. I noticed some interesting differences:</p>

<ul>
<li>There's a <strong>lot</strong> more graffitti in the men's toilets. In fact I learned a few interesting things from the wall of the cubicle...</li>
<li>All of the coat hooks on the back of the doors in the cubicles have come off, and are now fixed on the rear wall. What do the guys do with the hooks &mdash; do they have excessively heavy coats? Do they pull 20 chin-ups on them?</li>
<li>Before they switched the toilets over, someone screened off the urinals. Seemingly, the powers that be think that we women might have our delicate sensibilites offended, or might freak out if we caught a glimpse of the forbidden porcelain. How little they know us.</li>
</ul>

<p>My guess is that the men are probably marvelling at the virgin walls and the hooks on the back of the doors.</p>
