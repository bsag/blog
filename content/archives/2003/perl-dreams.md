<p>I'm getting on fairly well with learning Perl, but the fact that I can only study during the evenings and weekends is having an odd side effect &mdash; I've been programming in my dreams. I could be coding up a storm, whipping up killer Moveabletype plugins, or even my own custom content management system<sup>1</sup>, but I'll never know. All I'm left with when I wake up is a vivid impression of having done a lot of coding, together with a few variable names and snatches of syntax. Unfortunately, I don't remember what the programme was supposed to do &mdash; it's all a bit sad really.</p>

<sup>1</sup>Though nothing about my proficiency (or lack of it) while I'm awake would support this.
