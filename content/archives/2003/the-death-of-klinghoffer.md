<p>I normally manage to rave about good things on TV or radio <strong>after</strong> they've happened, which is &mdash; as my mum would say &mdash; a fat lot of good. So for once, I'm sending out a 'heads-up' before the event.</p>

<p>Channel 4 is televising <a href="http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/K/the_death_of_klinghoffer/index.html" title="Channel 4's page on Klinghoffer">'The Death of Klinghoffer'</a>; John Adams' opera about the hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro by Palestinian terrorists in 1985. Even if you think that you aren't a fan of opera, give it a go. The choruses in particular are heart-stopping, as <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/john-adams-harmonium-the-klinghoffer-choruses/">I've mentioned before</a>. I can't understand why it was so controversial when it was first premiered &mdash; I don't think that Adams could be any more balanced in his treatment. With the situation in the Middle East as tense as ever, the grief, anger and loss in the opera is more relevant and moving than ever.</p>
