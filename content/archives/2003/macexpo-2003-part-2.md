<p>Islington is an odd place; there are a lot of rather down-at-heel kinds of shops and caf&eacute;s, and many more very trendy up-market clubs and restaurants. I knew that there was a <a href="http://www.belgo-restaurants.com/">Bierodrome</a> somewhere near the MacExpo site, and since I wanted to have an early supper while waiting for the worst of rush hour to clear, I thought that I would go and check it out.</p>

<p>I was pleased to see that they had a rather unusual special offer on meals taken between 6 and 7:30pm. You pay a price equal the the time that you order. So, if you place your order at 6:30, you pay Â£6.30. And you get a half pint of Belgian beer in with the price! Fantastic!</p>

<p>I got there at about 5:45, and had a leisurely half of a rather nice wheat beer in the bar before casually sauntering round to the restaurant side at precisely 6:01. Well, I am trying to save money at the moment, so I think it was entirely justified. I had a huge bowl of <em>moules et frites</em> and another nice wheat beer, and felt that all was well with the world. There's something particularly satisfying about <em>moules et frites</em>. Perhaps it's that you can use the food itself as a utensil. I love picking out the meat of a mussel using the shell of another as a pair of tweezers, while inhaling the garlicky steam. I love cooking mussels, too. In fact, I love the sound of the shells clacking around in a sink so much that I once wrote a poem about it. Don't worry, I won't inflict it on you.</p>

<p>It was a lovely end to the day, and infinitely better than sitting on the coach in rush hour traffic.</p>
