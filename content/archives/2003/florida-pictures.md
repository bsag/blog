<p>I've uploaded the first batch of pictures I took in Florida to <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/wingsopenwide/index.html">wings open wide</a> -- all of which were taken with the digital camera. When I get a chance, I'll scan in some of the pictures I took with the Lomo. I also discovered that I could set more than one category for each image, so that it would appear in more than one gallery. So, for instance, some of this batch appears in both the Florida 2003 album and also in fauna or flora. When I get a chance, I might edit the others so that the categories make more sense.</p>
