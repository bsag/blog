<p>Sometimes you really have to wonder what goes on in inventors' minds. Take <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3103616.stm">this idea</a> for example--what exactly was the design process here? Let's take a look at the possible reasoning:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Problem</em> - Sometimes it's difficult to concentrate on your mobile phone conversation properly. Between the sirens, people shouting, and that cyclist you've just run over with your car hitting your window repeatedly with his broken wheel--well, it just isn't conducive to a serious conversation, is it?</li>
<li><em>Potential solutions</em> - You could always go and find a quiet, empty room and use your mobile, or even a landline. But wouldn't that defeat the usefulness of having a mobile phone in the first place, if you have to go somewhere special to use it?</li>
<li><em>Design solution</em> - Produce a pod-like helmet which is held above the water by three adjustable floats. You wear the helmet while immersed in a swimming pool kept at body temperature, and thus create an environment like an isolation tank, in which you are able to fully attend to your conversation. Now that is <em>so</em> much more convenient than finding a quiet room.</li>
</ol>

<p>It's always possible that I might read this again in a few years time when everyone owns a floating pod mobile phone, and feel like a right charlie, but somehow I think that's unlikely.</p>
