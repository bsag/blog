<p>What with all the excitement of <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/elementary-my-dear-watson">donning my deerstalker</a> earlier (what a sad life I lead), I forgot to mention my strange waking-up experience earlier today. I reached consciousness this morning already singing <a href="http://www.thomasdiehl.de/film/Songs/JungleBookSongs.html" title="Lyrics for the Bare Necessities">The Bare Necessities</a> from 'The Jungle Book' in my head. It's quite a jolly way to wake up to be sure, but suggests to me that I must be under a good deal more strain than I had previously suspected. Either that or I had some pretty freaky dreams that I don't remember at all.</p>
