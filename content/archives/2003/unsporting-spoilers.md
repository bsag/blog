<p>I was casually reading <a href="http://www.whiterabbits.com/MacNetJournal/#note_1419">Mac Net Journal</a> yesterday (always an interesting read), when my eyes fell upon an entry containing the result of the day's Tour de France stage, which I hadn't yet seen. Eeek. I tried to tear my eyes away, but my brain had already digested the news &mdash; it's a shame it doesn't work so efficiently when I'm reading academic papers. It also made me wish my brain had an 'Undo' button. Anyway, the Stage was a really exciting one, and made me realize what a unique sport cycling is.</p>

<p>If you haven't yet seen Stage 15 and want to, don't under any circumstances click the 'More...' button below.</p>

<p>I'm not going to rehash the whole race, as you can read a detailed report <a href="http://www.letour.fr/2003/us/index.html">here</a>, but I just wanted to mention a couple of things that struck me. It's one of the oddities of the Tour that the person leading on the road is not necessarily the most important: they are only winning a stage, not the whole Tour. So, Lance Armstrong (the current leader of the Tour) was most concerned about Jan Ullrich, who was only 15 seconds behind him in the overall standings. If Jan crossed the line more than 15 seconds ahead of Lance, he would have taken the Yellow Jersey from him. So Lance was pinned to Jan's wheel &mdash; so far, so uneventful. Then Lance got a bit too close to a spectator on a bend, someone's bag handles got caught on his handlebars, and he went down. What do you think happened next? Jan honks on the pedals and takes the opportunity to get a good lead? Well, no. Cycling is the oddest mixture of ruthlessness and chivalry. The rider's moral code dictates that the field should wait for riders who are down; indeed, Lance did the same for Jan in 2001 when he went down in a really nasty crash (though Lance didn't wait for Joseba Beloki when he had a horrible crash and fractured his femur on Stage 9). Lance came pounding back &mdash; no doubt stoked up by adrenaline &mdash; and made an attack, coming in with a 52 second lead over Jan Ullrich. When interviewed about it afterwards, Jan seemed admirably phlegmatic about the whole affair. He thought that it was the right thing to do, and admitted that he just couldn't keep up in the end.</p>

<p>It isn't all gallantry on the Tour. In previous years, riders have head-butted one another in sprints, thrown water bottles, and of course there was the drug scandal a few years ago. In the distant past, a rider was even disqualified for letting the train take the strain on a stage!</p>
