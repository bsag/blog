<p>This is fabulous--Safari 1.1 (included with Panther) <a href="http://whatdoiknow.org/">implements</a> the CSS <code>text-shadow</code> property. When I was learning about CSS, I remember reading about <code>text-shadow</code> and getting quite excited, before I realised that no current browser actually supported it. Judging by the nice examples produced by <a href="http://www.mediaworkers.de/text-align/shadow.html">Frank Limbacher</a>, the results can look pretty stunning.</p>

<p>When I get some free time (hah!), I might include some shadowed text as a special treat for Panther users, and wait for the rest of the browsers to catch up.</p>
