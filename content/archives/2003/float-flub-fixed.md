<p>My <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/do-not-adjust-your-sets">cry for help</a> was answered, and the problem is now fixed. <a href="http://www.richarderiksson.com/moveableblog/">Richard Eriksson</a> emailed me with the following information:</p>

<blockquote>You'd be surprised how common your problem is.  In my redesign [1], I came across the same bug.  But I stole the code from somewhere, tweaked it, and it was later revealed for all (by someone else [2]).

Hopefully that helps.  Be sure to read the comment in [1] as well.

<p>Zeldman describes the problem and solution better than I could, but the Javascript snippet -- written by <a href="http://www.youngpup.net" title="Youngpup.net">Aaron Boodman</a> -- seems to work fine. I have had to turn off the <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/nice-title-switcher" title="Nice Titles">Nice Titles</a> Javascript, though. <a href="http://www.fuddland.org.uk/blog/" title="fuddland">dvd</a> emailed me to tell me that, while the Boodman script fixed the problem, as soon as you mouse over a Nice Title enabled link, it breaks again. Since I didn't exactly have a flood of approving comments when I introduced Nice Titles (no one commented either way), it probably won't be missed -- except by me. Sniff.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks to all who commented, and do let me know if there are still problems.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>. Despite wanting to give masses of Brownie points and and thanks to Richard, and despite his name being clearly available in his URL, I managed to misspell it: one k and two s's. I've corrected it now - sorry Richard!</p>
