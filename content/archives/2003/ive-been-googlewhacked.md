<p>I had an exciting comment <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/blog/archives/000028.html">posted to this blog</a> today by <a href="http://davegorman.com">Saddo</a>, informing me that my site contains a <a href="http://www.googlewhack.com/">Googlewhack</a>. For those of you not familiar with the term, a Googlewhack is exactly two words, which &mdash; when entered as a Google search &mdash; return exactly one result. Apparently (and I have tried it), but she's a girl comes up as the only result for <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/blog/archives/000028.html">this particular search</a>! I'm not sure what this actually means, if anything. Perhaps I discuss a more diverse, obscure and almost totally unrelated set of topics than other websites.</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: Obviously the heat as addled my brain. Earlier on, I actually listed the two search terms on this page, which would have broken the Googlewhack once Google had spidered this page. D'oh!</p>
