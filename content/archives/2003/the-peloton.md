<p>This year's <a href="http://www.letour.fr/2003/us/index.html" title="Official Tour website">Tour de France</a> is turning into a cracker. Most of the stages have been really exciting, with brave break-away challenges being pulled back at the very last moment. Watching once such recapture a few days ago, it occurred to me to wonder what the <a href="http://secretsofthepeloton.com/" title="Secrets of the Peloton">peloton</a> sounds like. You don't get any sense of the sound from the TV coverage, but I imagine that if you are desperately clinging to a slender lead, the metallic hiss of chain on chainring and rumble of tyre on tarmac of the 200-odd bikes bearing down on you must feel like being pursued by a huge and hungry python.</p>
