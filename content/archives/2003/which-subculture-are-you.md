<p>I've just spent an unfeasable amount of time glued to <a href="http://www.exactitudes.com/" title="Exactitudes">this website</a>: two photographers from Rotterdam have collected and categorised a huge collection of subcultures. The photographs are displayed in groups, and the models are all posed in the same way to emphasise the similarity of dress and hairstyle within each subculture.</p>

<p>The whole thing is totally addictive, even though navigating to specific groups can only be done by clicking on a tiny thumbnail on the main page. As much as anything, the names that the photographers have labelled each group with are brilliant and bizarre &mdash; try to find the 'Gutterbitches', 'Toppers', 'Teknohippies' and 'Speedfreax'.</p>

<p>There's very little explanation of how the subcultures were identified, so I'm intrigued about how it was worked out. I wonder if the members of each group share anything other than their taste in clothes. Do they have similar interests, a similar outlook on life? Otherwise, the whole enterprise seems totally circular. Also, I think that picking people who have to wear a uniform (for example, the 'Butchers') is cheating.</p>
