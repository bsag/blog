<p>So <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/the-peloton/">there I was</a>, idly wondering what the peloton sounds like, when I see that Radio 4 has broadcast a programme called 'Bicycle Music' (no web page for the programme, but there's a listen again link on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/">this page</a>). It was an interesting &mdash; if somewhat odd &mdash; programme, with all sorts of musings about music inspired by bikes and the music made by bikes themselves. There was a section on the Tour de France, with an obligatory play of the Kraftwerk song of the <a href="http://www.astralwerks.com/kraftwerk/tour_de_france.html" title="Kraftwerk site - requires Flash">same name</a>, and a recording (yes, you've guessed it) of the peloton. It's almost as if the BBC is reading my mind &mdash; time for the tin-foil lined hat.</p>
