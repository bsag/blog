[<p>This](http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2003/04/04/bikram/index_np.html) goes against all the stereotypes of Yoga instructors. Is he chilled-out? I don't think so. Is he enlightened? Na-uh! It's certainly never like this in the yoga class I go to. I also think that trying to claim that certain postures are your own invention -- in a system which has been around <a href="http://www.allspiritfitness.com/library/features/aa012401a.shtml">since about 500 BC</a> -- is a bit cheeky.</p>

<p>It seems to also be part of a trend to 'modernise' traditional practices and pastimes, so that you need to buy lots of accessories before you take part in them. One of the great things about yoga is that you need almost nothing to practise it: a quiet room, roomy light clothing (of any kind), and a mat, rug or blanket to pad the floor a bit. You don't need special postures, 105 degree room temperatures or, for that matter, special skimpy yoga pants.</p>
