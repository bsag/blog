<p>When I was looking for a picture of a particular species of beetle yesterday, I came across <a href="http://living-jewels.com/photo.htm" title="Living Jewels">this</a> wonderful site, full of exquisite photographs of beetles. My favourite is <a href=":http://living-jewels.com/polybothris_sumptuosa_gema.htm" title="Polybothris sumptuosa gema">this</a> fantastic, metallic number. A little tip: any beetle with a species name which includes <em>gloriosa</em>, <em>sumptuosa</em>, <em>pulchra</em> or <em>resplendens</em> is likely to be a bit of a stunner.</p>

<p>Any mention of beetles always reminds me of JBS Haldane's famous quote:</p>

<blockquote>
What has the study of biology taught you about the Creator, Dr. Haldane?"  "I'm not sure, but He seems to be inordinately fond of beetles."
</blockquote>

<p>Update: I spoke a little too soon. I had to repost this entry when I discovered that all sorts of Bad Thingsâ¢ happen when you try to mix the MT-Textile way of specifying links and the normal HTML method. Must never do that again.</p>
