<p>I'm a big fan of the Coen brothers' films, but for some obscure reason, I'd never watched <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0093822">Raising Arizona</a> &mdash; one of their earliest films. We watched it at the weekend, having taped it earlier in the week, and I don't think that I've laughed so much in ages. It's certainly not as sophisticated as some of their later comedies, but for sheer knock-about humour, it really works. The sequence where H.I. is being chased around the neighbourhood by the police, some dogs and his wife &mdash; after he has held up a convenience store for some nappies &mdash; is a classic. For some reason, the conversation between one of the other convicts and an elderly shop keeper about balloons also killed me:</p>

<p>
EVELLE: Uh-huh . . .
Â He takes a plastic-covered squirt gun off a display rack and drops it on the counter.  He is looking around at the other impulse purchases displayed by the register; he unhooks a bag of balloons.
. . .These blow up into funny shapes at all?
Â GALE is trotting by in the opposite direction: "Weeeeee!"
CASHIER:   Well no. Unless round is funny.
EVELLE is pulling a gun out of his belt.
EVELLE:   All right, I'll take these too. Now you lie down back there-

<p>I don't think that it could ever replace <a href="http://www.thedudeshouse.com/">The Big Liebowski</a> in my affections as favourite comedy of all time ("the Dude abides, man. The Dude abides..."), but it was a lot of fun.</p>
