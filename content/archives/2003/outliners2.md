<p>This is the <a href="http://www.atpm.com/9.12/atpo.shtml">third part</a> in an excellent series about outliner applications on the Mac on ["About This Particular Macintosh(AtPM)":http://www.atpm.com]. I've always had problems <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/blog/archives/000455.html">remaining faithful</a> to one outliner, as none of them seem to do everything I want them to. As a consequence, I've got more outliner-type things on my Mac than you can waggle a mouse at.</p>

<p>I can think of many software reviewers (and for that matter, manual writers) who could learn a lot from AtPM: rather then telling you what the software does, they focus on what you might want to use it <em>for</em>. It seems to me that this is much more valuable than telling you <em>how</em> something works, which--if the application is reasonably well designed--should be fairly self-explanatory with a little exploration.</p>
