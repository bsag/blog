<p>Yesterday, I walked across the meadows after dark on my way home. I was slightly preoccupied with feeling a bit nervous--the path isn't that well lit, and I was trying to look as if I had serious ninja skills--so I got a bit of a shock when I saw a bright light near ground level. For a moment I thought it was a security light shining on the ground, but I realised with a slight shock that it was the moon reflected in the black water of the river.</p>

<p>It was close the the horizon, huge, the colour of yellow ochre and absolutely beautiful. I wish I'd had my camera with me, but then  standing in the middle of a rather isolated field in the dark with an expensive camera might not have been a very good idea anyway.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.iconfactory.com/ip_home.asp">iPulse</a>--which I read about on <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/pete.boardman/weblog/100029.html">Pete Boardman's</a> blog, and immediately got hopelessly addicted to--tells me that the moon is Waning Gibbous, 81% full and 19 days old. I'm sure it knows best.</p>
