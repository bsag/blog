<p>I've been trying to write grant and fellowship applications today  &mdash;  what a pain! Obviously, I'm trying to get money out of these people, so I don't want them hating me for naming names (though they are all much the same), but the application forms are driving me crazy. To give one example, they ask for aims <em>and</em> objectives  &mdash;  what's the difference, for crying out loud? Then, to cap it all, they ask you to outline the outcome of the project and publication plans. The <em>outcome</em>. What, am I psychic or something? And if I knew what would happen, there wouldn't be a lot of point in doing the research in the first place. Of course, I'd like to produce 4 papers a year from the project (all in <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/" title="Science Magazine">Science</a> or <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/" title="Nature online">Nature</a> naturally), but this is the real world, and the Harvard Law of Animal Behaviour applies: "laboratory animals under carefully controlled conditions do as they damn well please".</p>

<p>Does anyone make an application to write grants for you? GrantWriter v.6, or grntgrb for the command line junkies:</p>
