<p>I've put up a few pictures from my jaunt around the University Botanical Gardens over on <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/wingsopenwide/index.html ">wings open wide</a>. There weren't a lot of flowers in bloom in the main garden (understandably, given the season), so most of the images were taken in the glasshouses. I discovered some technical difficulties with taking photographs in a glasshouse: the lens kept steaming up, so I was wiping it every few minutes, and the light was rather subdued, so some of the pictures have a rather limited depth of field. Anyway, take a look and tell me what you think.</p>
