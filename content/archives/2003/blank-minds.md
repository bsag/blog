<p>I've just picked up on <a href="http://www.textism.com/article/672/" title="Curious">this discussion</a> on Textism concerning what you think about when you're not thinking of anything else. There are some great answers: my favourite was, "What would happen if I started a Slinky going down the up esclator?", and the scariest was, "Sex and viral vector purification via <span class="caps">HPLC</span>".</p>

<p>On the bus coming home yesterday, my thinking about nothing ran thusly. "Why has that guy got dark hair and a grey moustache? Does he dye his hair? I don't see any grey roots, and why wouldn't he dye his âtache too? Is it possible for just your facial hair to go grey? That's weird. Surely your facial hair is younger than your head hair. Idiot &mdash; they both get replaced every few days. Maybe he leaves it so that women will stare at him and wonder why his hair is dark and his âtache is grey. Must stop staring at him."</p>
