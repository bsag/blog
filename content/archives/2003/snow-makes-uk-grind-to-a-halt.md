<p>The recent <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2711977.stm" title="Snow chaos">snow chaos</a>, with motorists stuck in their cars for 20 hours, might have been tailor-made to showcase the Great British Stereotype. Namely:</p>


<ul>
 <li>British infrastructure, creaky at the best of times, inevitably buckles under the strain of totally unexpected events &mdash; such as a snow storm that was clearly indicated on all of the TV and Radio weather forecasts.</li>
 <li>Despite the fact most conversations between British people are principally to do with the weather in some way, we have a fundamental inability to cope with any meteorological conditions more extreme than a light drizzle.</li>
 <li>âPlucky' Brits stuck for 20 hours in their freezing cars on the M11 will always display a âBlitz spirit', making jokes and cups of tea for one another and singing "Roll Out The Barrel". Or so we are told. My arse.</li>
</ul>
