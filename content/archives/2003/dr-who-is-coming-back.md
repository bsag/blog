<p>This could be excellent news; a <a href="http://news.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/09/26/nwho26.xml">new series</a> of Dr. Who is going to be filmed. Russell T Davies---who created 'Queer As Folk'---is going to write the new series, which could either mean that it's really great or really bad. He is at least a big fan himself, and I've heard encouraging things about going back to the original feel of the series: an older and more eccentric Doctor, and perhaps even a return to the good old cheap rubber monsters, and scenes obviously shot in quarries.</p>

<p>To herald this momentous news on the Today programme, they played a previous clip of John Humphrys interviewing a dalek. It's really a classic. Part of the exchange went like this (you can hear the full version <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/runningorder/ram/today3_drwho_20030927.ram">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
*Humphrys*: Good morning.
*Dalek*: GOOD MORNING. I WAS PROMISED SUE MCGREGOR! [becoming more shrill and insistent] WHO ARE YOU?
*Humphrys*: I'm John Humphrys.
*Dalek*: NOT FOR LONG. EXTERMINATE!!
*Humphrys*: I think many people think that...
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, Tom Baker is the one true Doctor... The classic theme music (written by the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/experimental/reviews/radiophonic_music.shtml">BBC Radiophonic Workshop</a> in the days long before synthesisers were common) is also the best SciFi theme music ever.</p>
