<p>My Sunday early evening treat is watching <a href="http://www.channel4.com/science/microsites/S/scrapheap/challenges/jet_racer/index.html">Scrapheap Challenge</a> (and Andromeda, but that's a guilty pleasure). This week's challenge was a particular treat &mdash; the teams had to build a jet-propelled racer. If you've never seen a jet-powered go-cart zooming down a dragster track, then &mdash; by crikey &mdash; it's about time you did! The <a href="http://www.dmu.ac.uk/~jamesa/learning/dissonance.htm">cognitive dissonance</a> involved in seeing something that looks like a shopping trolley making a sound like a 747 on take off nearly killed me.</p>

<p>The element of danger is always an appealing part of Scrapheap Challenge, and the heady combination of tanks of propane and kerosene and spark plugs in close proximity to a rather scantily-protected driver gave quite a frisson of excitement to the proceedings. Not that I want anyone to be hurt, I hasten to add &mdash; I just like to see things burst into flames, which one of the vehicles obligingly did on this occasion. Excellent.</p>
