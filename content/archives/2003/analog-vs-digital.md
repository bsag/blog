<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/today/">Today Programme</a> had a bit of a departure this morning, with an interview with <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/reports/features/whitestripes.shtml">The White Stripes</a> on Radio 4. It was introduced in a slightly self-congratulatory tone, with the information that Mark Coles first interviewed them for 'Today' in 2001 <em>before they were famous</em>. John Humphris didn't quite say, "Yo kidz, we're down with the wikkid sounds", but he was dying to.</p>

<p>Anyway, what interested me about the interview was the discussion about the relative merits of digital versus analogue recording. They are fans of old recording equipment from the 1960s -- Jack White made the point that if it isn't a good song, no amount of digital tweaking will make it good. He also said that analogue systems force you to be inventive and creative -- digital systems make things too easy and you get lazy, producing sterile, formulaic music. I don't like The White Stripes' music much (I must be getting old -- they seem too raucous to me), but I do like their philosophy.</p>

<p>I'm a poster-girl for technology -- I love it -- but I do appreciate and value the older ways of doing things. I think you have to evaluate every method, and see which is best -- it won't always be the digital way, and faster/easier doesn't necessarily equal better. I remember the first time I heard a decent valve amplifier at a Hi-Fi show. The warmth and living, breathing quality of the sound just floored me. And my <a href="http://shop.lomography.com/orbiz/DigiTrade/e519fdf1b3fa05ec108d3ce027128549a5ad562116efbaf7ab1b8b92d46e254c/shop/main.html?cat=&amp;pro=lca">Lomo</a> is getting me excited about photography all over again. I won't be giving up the digital camera or my TiBook any time soon, though.</p>
