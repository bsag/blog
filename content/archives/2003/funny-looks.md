<p>One of these days, I'm going to take my <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/blog/archives/000207.html">Lomo</a> out on my recumbent bike, set the focus distance to 3 m and take photographs of the looks of amazement, surprise, amusement and derision on the faces of passers-by.</p>

<p>Keeping my balance whilst snapping away and pedalling at the same time might be a little tricky, but difficulty should never get in the way of art. I'll tell that to the nurse when I end up in Casualty (translation for non-UK residents: the Emergency Room) with broken bones.</p>
