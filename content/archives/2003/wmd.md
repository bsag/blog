<p>I'm sure everyone in the world must have heard about this by now (even my Mum probably knows about it), but if you haven't had a look yet, do yourself a favour and try the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Visit Google and type in "Weapons of Mass Destruction" (without the quotes)</li>
<li>Hit the "I'm feeling lucky" button, rather than the standard search</li>
<li>Laugh a lot</li>
</ul>
