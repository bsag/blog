<p>This is a great alternative rendering of the map of the <a href="http://craphound.com/images/tubemap.jpg">London Underground</a>. Many years ago, I used to go out with a guy who lived in Ongar, so I have painful memories of the weeks it seemed to take to get from central London to deepest, darkest Essex on the Tube. Once--on a return trip--a drunk man fell asleep on my shoulder somewhere around <a href="http://www.theydon.org.uk/">Theydon Bois</a>. In typical British fashion, I was too embarrassed to move somewhere else and wake him up.</p>
