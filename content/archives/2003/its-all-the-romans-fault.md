<p>I heard an interesting snippet on the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/">Today</a> programme yesterday morning. Apparently, a bronze Roman statue had been found in London depicting a Roman with the usual sandals and--this is the important bit--socks. It seems that the Romans went <em>au naturel</em> in the foot department in Italy, but donned the socks in Britain. The gloss on the story was that this shows the heritage of the Britons' much derided penchant for the socks and sandals look. Cue lots of "What have the Romans ever done for us?" comments... Well, it is the silly season--not that there's any dearth of serious news at the moment.</p>

<p>I would provide a link to the story, but I can't find one anywhere. I makes me wonder if it was all an elaborate hallucination, brought on by an early morning caffeine deficiency.</p>
