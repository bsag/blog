<p>This is <em>so</em> up my street--an <a href="http://www.perladvent.org/2003/">advent calendar</a> that also gives you geeky Perl tips. What more could a geek girl want for Christmas?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.perladvent.org/about/">description</a> of the site for non-Christians is pretty funny too:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Or if you're not Christian, it's a site that annually features descriptions of a new module for twenty five days starting on the first of December.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I heartily endorse the secular description, but it's not quite as concise as "Advent Calendar", is it?</p>
