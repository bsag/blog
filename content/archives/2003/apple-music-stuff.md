<p>Lots of exciting audio related things from Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/music/" title="Apple Music">were announced</a> yesterday. I had an orgy of installing and downloading, and what follows are my first impressions of the software:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>iTunes 4</strong>: the music sharing feature is long awaited, and very welcome. I tested it quickly last night, and it seems to work rather well (once I'd figured out which port to open on the firewall: <a href="http://www.macnn.com/news/19288" title="MacNN - Reader's reports on iTunes 4">3689</a> in case you're trying to figure it out too). 'Course, I have a <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/" title="Slimdevices">SliMP3</a> player to do that, but it tickles me that I could play my home iTunes library at work (and be Dr. Popular with Computing Services for all the bandwidth I'd be using). The AAC encoding option is a good step forward. I need to do a full-on audio-geek blind listening test comparing an AAC and an MP3 file of the same material on the same equipment, but my initial impressions are that the sound quality is indeed a bit better. The problem is that unless the guys at <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/">Slimdevices</a> come up with an AAC decoder for the server, I won't be able to encode all my files as AAC.</li>
<li><strong>iPods:</strong> Mmmm...new iPods. The new hardware looks very swish, though I'm not convinced about the look of the new buttons. I think they might have to grow on me. The firmware changes are a great improvement, as many people have requested creation of playlists from the iPod itself. Imagine my disappointment when I find that they haven't included this feature in the updater for the old style iPods. Like <a href="http://www.macslash.org/articles/03/04/28/176230.shtml" title="MacSlash - new iPods">many others</a>, I'm hoping that this will eventually work it's way down to those of us who don't want to (OK, can't afford to) upgrade to the new hardware. I can't imagine that that there's any hardware constraint preventing them from adding it to the old white bricks.</li>
<li><strong>Apple Music service</strong>: Sigh. Like an idiot, I hadn't read any of the news about the new service before firing up iTunes 4 and clicking 'Music Store'. Imagine my dismay when I get a message that since I am not one of The Chosen (i.e. I don't happen to live in the U.S.), I can look all I like, but I can't actually <strong>buy</strong> anything. I'm <a href="http://www.antipixel.com/blog/archives/2003/04/29/the_apple_music_store.html" title="Antipixel">not</a> the <a href="http://www.benhammersley.com/archives/004603.html#004603" title="Ben Hammersley">only</a> one who <a href="http://danhon.com/ec/mtarchives/000504.shtml" title="ext|circ">thought</a> it was a bit of a bummer.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm sure that Apple probably had to fight tooth and nail with the shambling dinosaur that is the recording industry to even get that far, but I still feel a bit like Oliver Twist:</p>

<p>[Me, shyly approaching Apple with my credit card cradled in my outstretched hands]: Please sir, can I buy some music?</p>

<p>[Apple, roaring incredulously]: Whaat? Buy some music? From Britain? Absolutely not! Now go away you cheeky urchin!</p>

<p>[I start to walk away and then screw my courage up and turn back &mdash; still holding out credit card beseechingly]: Please sir, could I perhaps also buy some prints online and order a Book from iPhoto?</p>

<p>[Apple, enraged now, throws an empty CD case at me]: Grraaaarrr!!</p>

<p>[I exit, stage left, to go and press my nose up against the window of the sweet shop.]</p>
