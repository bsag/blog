<p>I got a text message from a stranger on my mobile this morning. Apparently, Liz was given my number by Louise, and she was wondering if I wanted to go out for a drink. I see three possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have a secret female admirer. Interesting, but very unlikely.</li>
<li>It's spam. I've never got SMS spam before, but there's always a first time.</li>
<li>Someone keyed in a wrong number.</li>
</ul>

<p>If it was a wrong number, Liz is probably &mdash; at this very moment &mdash; agonising over why the object of her affections didn't text her back. Did he/she get it? Did he/she not want to go out with her? I would text her back and put her out of her misery, but for the second possibility.</p>
