<p>While I was on the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/classic/A846065" title="Meaning of Liff on H2G2">H2G2 site</a>, I found this definition of Ansty (a place I've <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/names/" title="Names">mentioned here before</a>), according to the Meaning of Liff:</p>

<blockquote>Ansty (adj.) Descriptive of a computer mouse icon pointer that refuses to move no matter how much you gyrate the mouse. </blockquote>

<p>Fantastic! I've got the Meaning of Liff, but I'd forgotten that Ansty was included.</p>
