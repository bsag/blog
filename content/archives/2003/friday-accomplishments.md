<p>Sometimes to-do lists have a function. It's true that most of the time they just mock you silently for falling behind with their endless tyrannical demands, but sometimes &mdash; just sometimes &mdash; they are a source of satisfaction. This morning, I had 15 items on my to-do list (anything over 10 makes me hyperventilate), and they were all reasonably non-trivial and urgent things. This evening, I have 7Â½. The bonus is that it happened on a Friday, so that I can go into the weekend with a profound feeling of Zen calm with my productive day behind me.</p>

<p>Ticking check-box on the list is pretty satisfying by itself, but what I'd really like is some kind of automatic reinforcement system. My computer could dispense a yummy square of dark chocolate for each completed item, or better still, I could get my lateral hypothalamus (the â<a href="http://www.mnimg.com/Articles/Lifestyle%20&%20Wellness/Fat%20Hormone%20and%20Brain's%20Pleasure%20Center.htm" title="Fat hormone and brain's pleasure center">pleasure center</a>' zapped wirelessly to give me a little bolt of happiness. The result would be a <a href="http://www.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de/genetics/behavior/learning/behaviorism.html" title="Operant conditioning and behaviorism">operantly-conditioned</a> response to completing tasks &mdash; ideal! Alternatively, I would just cheat and tick the box anyway to get the hit, which &mdash; let's face it &mdash; is the much more likely scenario.</p>
