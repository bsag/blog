<p>Those Tour de France riders really are made of steel. Tyler Hamilton is continuing to compete despite a broken collar bone, another had a high fever and Jimmy Casper had to ride in a neck brace because of a severe neck injury. Jimmy was interviewed after the stage and asked if it wasn't really painful cycling with a neck injury. Instead of yelling, "Well what do you think!", as I would have done, he just shrugged his shoulders in a rather Gallic way and said, "We are not girls."</p>

<p>Well, they may shave their legs<sup>1</sup>, but I think we can definitely say that they aren't girly.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>"It helps the wounds to heal when we get road rash injuries". Yeah, right...</p>
