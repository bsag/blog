<p>Some Apple-related interested news today:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/ibook/" title="New iBooks at Apple">New iBooks</a> &mdash; Apple have announced a speed bump for the iBook. They now have 900 chunks worth of megahertzy goodness, plus larger hard drives. I love the new AlBooks, but I'm still very fond of the iBook. I think it's something about the shiny, snowy look. And the Linux geeks love 'em. [via <a href="http://www.whiterabbits.com/MacNetJournal/April2003.html#note_1077" title="MacNetJournal">MacNetJournal</a>]</li>
<li><a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,1036539,00.asp" title="eWeek">Panther rumours</a> &mdash; some interesting speculation about what might appear in the next revision of MacOSX. Fast user switching would be very welcome. (Mr. Bsag and I spend a lot of time waiting for each other's applications to quit or restart when we log each other in and out. I share everything with my hubby except a user environment &mdash; what he does with a desktop is shocking. And don't even get me started on his desktop picture...) The 'piles' idea sounds intriguing too, but did they have to give it such a "Carry On" name? It reminds me less of a feature of a modern, go-ahead operating system and more of elderly people queuing at the chemist for some ointment.
