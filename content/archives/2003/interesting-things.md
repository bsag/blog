<p>An interesting fact I learned today, in the course of totally legitimate work-related research on laterality (or 'handedness'*): true hermaphrodites always have a functional ovary on the left and a functional testis on the right. Also, in most men, the left testicle hangs lower than the right, despite being lighter. I don't have a large enough sample size to personally confirm either of these facts, but I will be paying much closer attention in future.</p>

<p>These were the <em>only</em> interesting gleanings in a very long and dense paper, but it was almost worth it for them. This kind of information ought to be gold dust in pub quizzes.</p>

<p>*This is a somewhat misleading term. You can get handedness, beakedness, pawedness, eyedness and even whales tend to list slightly one side.</p>
