<p>While I'm on the <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/equal-opportunities/">subject of bras</a>, there's a funny little snippet in today's <a href="http://society.guardian.co.uk/societyguardian/story/0,7843,1021659,00.html">Guardian Society</a> from the Romford Recorder:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
More than 120 bras have been discarded at a popular pub in Romford, Essex, and now a lost property phoneline has been set up to reunite items with owners.
_Romford Recorder, 1/08/03_

<p>There has to be a potential novel lurking in there somewhere...</p>
