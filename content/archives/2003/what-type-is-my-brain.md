<p>I read the article in the Guardian today about the differences between male and female brains by Simon Baron-Cohen (as far as I know, he's no relation of <a href="http://alig.com/">Ali G</a>). His hypothesis is that people have empathising qualities or systemising qualities. More women than men have a predominantly empathetic brain, and more men than women have a predominantly systemising brain. The basic idea isn't exactly new, but there was a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/news/page/0,12983,937443,00.html" title="Take the E/S test yourself">test</a> you could take online to see which kind of brain you have. In the name of scientific research  &mdash;  and curious about what I would find, since even I regard myself as a bit of an odd fish  &mdash;  I decided to give it a go.</p>

<p>After 120 questions, I was beginning to wish I hadn't even started, but  &mdash;  for what it's worth  &mdash;  my results are below. There were 60 questions for each of the tests, each with four possible responses; definitely agree or slightly agree, slightly disagree, definitely disagree. Some of the questions are just plain funny or bizarre. For example on the EQ test:
</p>

<blockquote>When I was a child, I enjoyed cutting up worms to see what would happen.</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, there was no "What kind of psychopathic freak do you take me for!" response available. On the SQ test, this question made me chuckle:
</p>

<blockquote>When travelling by train, I often wonder exactly how the rail networks are coordinated.</blockquote>

<p>In the UK, everyone travelling by train wonders how the hell the rail networks are <strong>not</strong> coordinated, and they then go on to speculate about the train operators inability to organize a piss up in brewery.</p>

<p>I tried to answer the questions as honestly as possible, so  &mdash;  drum roll, please  &mdash;  here are the scores on the doors:</p>

<blockquote>EQ score is 59

53-63 = You have an above average ability for understanding how other people feel and responding appropriately. You know how to treat people with care and sensitivity. On average most women score about 47 and most men about 42.

SQ score is 41

40-50 = You have an above average ability for analysing and exploring a system. On average women score about 24 and men score about 30. Most people with Asperger Syndrome or high functioning autism score between 40-50.</blockquote>

<p>Well, there's a turn up! Apparently, this means I have a 'type B' or 'balanced brain'. Or, as I said earlier, I am an odd fish with both traditionally male and traditionally female interests and propensities. I have my doubts about research which draws its data from these types of questionnaires. It seems too easy for participants to see (even subconsciously) which are the 'correct' responses, and bias their answers accordingly. If there is a societal norm for each sex (and I think that there still is) people would probably be subconsiciously reluctant to answer in a way that goes against this norm. Having said that, societal norms probably have at least a kernel of biological truth.</p>

<p>I also have problems with the pictures that The Guardian chose to illustrate the piece with. Both photographs appear to date from the 1950s: on one side of the page, a girl in a nurse's uniform takes the pulse of her doll. On the other side, a boy does manly things with his screwdriver to his meccano model. Despite the fact that Baron-Cohen makes the point repeatedly that not all men have a systemising brain, and not all women have an empathising brain, he comes out with some sweeping generalisations:</p>

<blockquote>Women are more likely to spend hours happily engaged in coffee mornings or pot-luck suppers, advising friends on relationship problems or caring for friends, neighbours or pets.
</blockquote>

<p>Does anyone engage in coffee mornings any more (happily or otherwise)? I scored above average on EQ, but I don't identify at all with that description (except perhaps for the bit about pets).</p>
