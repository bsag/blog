<p><a href="http://www.fuddland.org.uk/blog/">dvd's</a> comment about favelets <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/blog/archives/000237.html">yesterday</a> reminded what fabulous things they are. The favelets outlining and labelling divs at <a href="http://www.accessify.com/tools-and-wizards/accessibility-checking-favelets.asp">Accessify </a> are genuinely useful, and can highlight problems that you could fail to find after hours of staring at the code. A couple of days ago, after <a href="http://www.zeldman.com">Zeldman</a> mentioned it, I checked out the Ruler favelet at <a href="http://www.centricle.com/tools/favelets/">Centricle</a> which allows you to select regions of a page and see a very neat box giving the pixel dimensions and positions of the selection. I don't know about you, but I haven't done enough web design yet to intuitively <em>know</em> what 100 pixels look like.</p>

<p>The prize for most useful favelet of the day goes to <a href="http://www.efritz.net/PseudoAutoFill.html">Autofill</a> (found via <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20030406104324521">Macosxhints</a> -- it gives you the convenience of autofilled forms with any browser. Given that autofill was the <em>only</em> thing I liked about IE, this is fantastic.</p>

<p>(A note for Safari users: trying to drag favelets onto the bookmark bar will only result in an embarrassing crash: you have to control-click/right-click the link and choose "Add to bookmarks".)</p>
