<p>It's been a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,867416,00.html" title="Wet revels">rather damp</a> start to the New Year here. As if it wasn't bad enough going back to work after Christmas, I had to get there through a biblical deluge. The Isis (the Thames, for normal people<sup>1</sup>) has grown enormously. I might curse the fact that I live on a hill when I have to cycle back up it, but it does mean that I don't get soggy carpets three times a year.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Oxford people are a funny lot: the river has a perfectly serviceable name, but they have to go and give it another one with Classical pretentions so that the plebs won't get the reference.</p>
