<p>I came across <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/nicetitle/" title="Nice Titles">this</a> very useful tip for making transparent tool tips via <a href="http://nslog.com/archives/2003/03/13/starting_a_blog_with_movabletype.php" title="NSLog() - starting a blog">NSLog()</a> (itself a very interesting article of starting a weblog). I've been bugged for a while at the lack of tool tips in Safari, and the current implementation of having them appear in the status bar doesn't seem very logical as they don't appear where your cursor is pointing. I <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/archives/2003_03.html#002604" title"Dave Hyatt's weblog">gather</a> that they'll revert to the usual tool tip method in the next revision, but this is a nice workaround in the meantime. Roll your mouse over the links in this (or any other) entry to see the effect. Cool isn't it? Of course, it's likely that this breaks something on another browser so <a href="mailto:butshesagirl@rousette.org.uk" title="Send me an email">let me know</a> if it does.</p>
