<p>So, there's a <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">new version</a> of Safari, complete with tabs, autofill forms and a 'Reset Safari' option to trash all incriminating browsing evidence with <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/user/view/wlg/3059">one flick of the mouse</a> -- perfect for guilty spouses or shifty employees!</p>

<p>Let's say -- hypothetically, of course -- that someone might have got his or her sticky little hands on a leaked early build of Safari when someone else posted a download link on <a href="http://www.macslash.org/article.pl?sid=03/02/24/1351255&amp;mode=thread">Macslash</a>, and that this person used the leaked version quite extensively and rejoiced to be able to use tabs again. That person might also report that v73 seems to be much more stable and have an even better implementation of tabs, and more accurate CSS rendering. This hypothetical person might say such a thing if they actually existed, which of course they don't, because they're hypothetical.</p>
