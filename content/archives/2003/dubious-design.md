<p>A couple of links to things that I ought to think are cool but somehow I just don't.</p>


<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.bookofseg.com/" title="Book of Seg">Segway<sup>TM</sup> Human Transporter</a>: I applaud anything that might get more people out of their cars, if they can't use a bicycle for the journey for some reason, but there are two problems. First, it makes you look like <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/doctorwho/alien/davros.shtml" title="Davros">Davros</a> from Dr. Who. If I rode one, I would have an irrepressible urge to shout, "You will be exterminated! Resistance is useless!" Second, I have a sneaking suspicion that instead of being used for commuting, it will just replace any situation in which the owner might have actually used their legs. Having visited the States and seen how many opportunities there are to avoid walking (drive in fast food joints, pharmacies and ATMs, for crying out loud), this can only be a bad thing.</li>
 <li>The <a href="http://www.combimouse.com/index.htm" title="Combimouse">Combimouse</a>. When I first saw this, I thought, "Hmm, that looks cool". But I just can't get my head around how the heck you would actually use it. It seems to me that it would be like trying to pat your head and rub your tummy at the same time. And wielding the right-hand bit around as a mouse just seems plain clumsy. Perhaps it works well in practice &mdash; I'd like to give it a go anyway.</li>
</ul>
