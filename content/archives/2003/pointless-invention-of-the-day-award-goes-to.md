<p>Just what the world needs: <a href="http://www.popcornfork.com/" title="The amazing popcorn fork">a new eating utensil</a> for people who can't coordinate their bowl-mouth popcorn action. Actually if you can't get popcorn in your mouth without a utensil, you probably shouldn't be trusted with pointy plastic objects &mdash; you'll have our eye out.</p>

 <p>From the publicity blurb:</p>

 <blockquote>Hi, I'm Don Sothman. Now you, too, can say good-bye to greasy fingers and paper napkins.Â  With new finger foods coming to market almost daily, the least I can do is help clean up this delicious mess! </blockquote>

 <p>Replace âDon Sothman' with â<a href="http://www.snpp.com/guides/troy.mcclure.html" title="Troy McClure">Troy McClure</a>â, and the Popcorn Fork might be up there with Styro-Glow: "the incredibly simple seventeen-step solution that makes your styrofoam look brand new".
