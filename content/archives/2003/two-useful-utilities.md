<p>I've been using a couple of terribly handy wee apps recently.</p>


<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.codetek.com/php/virtual.php" title="Codetek">Virtual Desktop</a>. When I used Linux extensively, one of the things I most loved about the window managers was the virtual desktops. <a href="http://www.enlightenment.org/pages/main.html" title="Enlightenment Window Manager">Enlightenment</a> had a particularly beautiful one (though a bit memory hungry), which rendered the windows in the pager. When I moved to MacOS X, I missed using a hotkey to flip to my terminals or email window. So when I saw Virtual Desktop in beta, I applied to become a beta tester. I liked it, but the first release still had a few rough edges, so I didn't get it. Browsing around recently, I had a look at the most recent version and found that they had improved it immensely. I'm not sure I could be without it now. I have 9 virtual desktops to flip between, and I've set up certain apps to open their windows on a particular desktop. There are multiple ways to change desktops or get to certain windows; by clicking on the window in the pager, using a hotkey (I have mine tied to the function keys), or by using the menubar. It's much tidier and easier than selectively hiding windows, and I find that by grouping things by function (web, office, email, documents, pim etc.) I can focus on the task I'm doing better.</li>

 <li><a href="http://www.blacktree.com/apps/index.html?pith/index.html" title="Blacktree OS X Apps">Pith</a>. As in 'helmet', not 'taking the'. I'm a convert to Safari, but like legions of others, I miss Chimera's/Mozilla's tabs. While Apple decides whether or not tabbed interfaces contravene their <span class="caps">HID</span> guidlines, I'm using Pith. It isn't a perfect replacement for tabs, but it works very well. There was <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20030203052103971#comments" title="Emulating tabbed windows in Safari">hint</a> on MacOSXHints about using Pith in conjunction with <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/castiglione/software.html" title="Bananasoft Productions">FullScreenSafari.ape</a> which stops Safari from splurging new windows all over the screen. I like my windows to be all tidily lined up at the screen edge. And, no, I don't iron my socks.</li>
</ul>
