<p>I've started using <a href="http://www.blogrolling.com" title="Set up a blogroll">Blogrolling</a> to organise my blogroll. It's all nicely sorted alphabetically, and recent updates (within the last 12 hours) are marked with an asterisk. It's a really nice system, and makes it much easier to keep on top of the links.</p>
