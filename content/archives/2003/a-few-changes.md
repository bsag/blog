<p><img class="pixframesmall" src="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/blog/archives/images/textshadows.jpg" alt="an example of shadowed text" height="39" width="163" border="0"  />An email from <a href="http://cgi.synchrony.plus.com/blog/">D. J. Nightingale</a> about my blog design prompted me to make some minor but long overdue changes to the design of the page. He pointed out that I could position my images a bit more cleanly using CSS rather than the clunky <code>vspace</code> and <code>hspace</code> attributes I used because I was in a hurry. So, I've finally pulled my finger out and got on with it. Things should look a bit neater now. The row of 'wings open wide' thumbnails was also in a mess and had been irritating me for ages. Finally, while I was rummaging around in the style sheet I set up shadowed text for the date header above each entry. If you don't have Safari 1.1, you won't see it, so I've provided the screenshot above to show you folks what you're missing!</p>
