<p><a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2002_12_29_archive.shtml#90137744" title="Plasticbag.org">Tom Coates</a> has a link to an interesting <a href="http://forums.upmystreet.com/forums/topic.php3?l1=wc1a+1up&msgno=3329574" title="UpMyStreet">UpMyStreet</a> conversation in Hackney, London. The UpMyStreet conversations are an interesting concept anyway: our communities are now so fragmented that it's easier to talk to someone in the next street online than in person. In this case, that's because there's a crazed gunman besieging the street.</p>

<p>The last time I tried UpMyStreet out for my own area, I found an advert for a flat in the very same block that I live in. Now, we rent our place, but the price of this (identical) flat nearly made me choke on my tea. My landlady must never find out, or she'll be putting the rent up.</p>
