<p>I continued to work on my grant applications today, setting out my ideas for experiments in the project. I switched briefly to my browser (Safari - yay!) to look some information up, then switched back to the text editor again. For a fraction of a second I thought, âHang on &mdash; someone's nicked my super-cool experimental idea.' Then I thought, âOh. Yes. It's me.'</p>

<p>Sometimes I worry about myself, I really do.</p>
