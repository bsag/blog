<p>[Sunday 23rd March]</p>

<p>Phew. Airboats are fast. And noisy. And probably really bad for the environment. Buy boy are they fun! We thought that we really had to have a go on one while we were in Florida. Actually, we saw quite a bit of wildlife on the trip -- lots of birds, some lovely dragonflies and an alligator some way off in the distance.</p>

<p>The first time you ride on an airboat and the driver heads straight for a patch of reeds, you can't help thinking "Aaarggg! We're going to crash!". This wears off after a bit, and then it gets quite fun -- though wearing the ear defenders is a really good idea, or you end up shouting at everyone for hours afterwards.</p>
