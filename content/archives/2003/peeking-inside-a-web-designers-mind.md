<p>Having wrestled with designing my own web sites in a rather amateurish fashion, I'm fascinated with the way in which professional designers might go about the process. I've also been marvelling at the gorgeous designs in the <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/" title="A demonstration of CSS based design">CSS Zen Garden</a>, so I noted <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/articles/process/" title="A Design Process Revealed">Douglas Bowman's description</a> of the processes involved in <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=017/017.css">his Zen Garden</a> entry with great interest. I found it interesting that the 'measure twice, cut once' advice holds even with an electronic product. I think that might be at least part of my problem: I rush in there without planning what I want to do clearly enough, and then spend a lot of time bumbling about and changing my mind <em>after</em> I've written a lot of code.</p>
