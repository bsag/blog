<p>My brother told me some sad news today; it seems that neither of us had heard that <a href="http://www.elliottsmith.com/">Elliott Smith</a> had <a href="http://www.nme.com/news/106511.htm">died of an apparent suicide</a> in late October of this year. He was 34--one year older than me.</p>

<p>We are both big fans, so this was quite a shock. His music sometimes reminded me a bit of <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/blog/archives/000466.html">Nick Drake</a>, which--given that they both met a similarly sad end--seems somehow appropriate. Goodbye, Elliott--I'll miss your music.</p>
