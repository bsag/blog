<p>As I'm now technically semi-employed after the end of my contract (it's a long story), I've been frantically applying for jobs. This morning, a University which shall remain nameless rejected my application. Just to rub salt into the wound--followed by a nice dash of vinegar--they sent me <em>two</em> identical rejection letters. Thanks a lot! I think I've got the message now.</p>
