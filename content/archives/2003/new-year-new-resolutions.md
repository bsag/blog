<p> I don't hold much truck with resolutions: either they are so easy to keep that there isn't much point in making them, or they are so hard to keep (and here I include those old favourites, 'lose weight, get more exercise, be more organised') that they are impossible to keep. I also question the sanity of trying to change your life at a time when it's dark and cold, and you are deflated and depressed after the fun of the festivities. Still, I enjoy reading other <a href="http://fray.com/hope/2003/" title="Hopes for 2003">people's resolutions</a>.</p>
<p>If I was forced at gunpoint to make a resolution, I would make it in the spring, and it would be to remember to live - it's too easy these days to forget. I should look more, and see little things. I would also like to live more in the present. Worrying about the future is a quick way to suffocate yourself.</p>
