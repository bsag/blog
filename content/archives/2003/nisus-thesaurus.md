<p>I like words. I like using them inventively and correctly, but I often need a lot of help. While I own several paper dictionaries and thesauruses (thesauri? I rest my case...), I'm a fan of the electronic versions because they obviate the need for that tedious trudge to the bookcase. Enter the new, free <a href="http://www.nisus.com/Thesaurus/">Nisus Thesaurus</a>; it's a neat little Cocoa application, with matching Services menu for quick lookup of words in other applications. Using it is pretty straightforward: you enter your word in the input box at the top, hit return, and wait for a plethora of synonyms to turn up. You get words that are similar to, opposite to, more general than, or more specific than the word you selected, and a definition of the word as well. It's all very neat, and seems to come with quite a decent database of words.</p>

<p>I was trying to think of a word to test it with, and for some reason came up with 'discombobulate'. An evil grin spread over my face--"That'll fox it" I thought. But it didn't. I even got two related definitions of discombobulate, including alternative words such as bemuse, bewilder, fox (ha!) and fuddle. In case you are curious, here are the definitions:</p>

<p><em>discombobulate</em> (as in "bewilder") <em>v</em>. : cause to be confused emotionally</p>

<p><em>discombobulate</em> (as in "confuse") <em>v</em>. : be confusing or perplexing to; cause to be unable to think clearly: "These questions confuse even the experts"; "This question completely threw me"; "This question befuddled even the teacher"</p>
