<p>Sorry about the disappearance of the 'Nice titles' switcher in the sidebar on the right. I was trying to improve it by changing it into a radio button, which would also show the current state, and--well, I broke it. And I didn't make a backup of the file before I started.</p>

<p>This is what happens when you try writing JavaScript when you've got a heavy cold. I'll endeavour to get something working when I'm feeling a bit better. By the way, does anyone know how to test a script involving cookies offline, without having a web server running locally?</p>
