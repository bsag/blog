<p>I've added a new section to my sidebar &mdash; 'Friends and family'. As I'm sure the mentally agile among you have already guessed from the name, it's a place for links to sites run by people I know. So, <a href="http://www.artfall.co.uk">Mr. Bsag's</a> site is up there, as is my friend Joe's new site, <a href="http://itotd.com">Interesting Thing of the Day</a>. It is &mdash; as the name suggests &mdash; a fantastic mine of excellent writing about interesting things. If you've ever wanted to know about leaf cutter ants, bubble tea, the Battle of Dunkirk or lightsabres (amongst many other Interesting Things), this is the place for you. Take a look &mdash; it does exactly what it says on the tin.</p>

<p>Oh, and unlike the <a href="http://www.bt.com/fnf/index.jsp?showsub=account_management&showsub3=AM_Friends_&_Family&obsNoSee=Y&vStore=1120&obsPage=/at_home.jsp&obsType=LINK&obsOID=46369" title="BT Friends and Family information">BT scheme</a> of the same name, there are no concessions on these sites for my friends or family. For that matter, I don't even get a reduced price. Sorry.</p>
