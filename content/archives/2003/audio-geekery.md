<p>My brother was visiting over the weekend and &mdash; as often happens on such occasions &mdash; we ended up in an expensive hi-fi shop, promising ourselves that we were 'just looking'. As we browsed the various gorgeous and ruinously expensive bits of equipment on the shelves, the following exchange took place between us:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Brother</strong>: I know it sounds a bit pervy, but come and twiddle this selection knob!
<strong>Me</strong> [twiddling a huge, solid aluminium knob on a <a href="http://www.musicalfidelity.com/">Musical Fidelity</a> amp]: Ooo, nice. Do you think we can just buy the knob mounted on a bit of aluminium?
</blockquote>

<p>We are truly sad people.</p>
