<p>This news seems so weird it must be a fake, but apparently it is now <a href="http://www.metro.co.uk/metro/weird/article.html?in_page_id=4&in_article_id=10289" title="Metro Cafe">illegal to kill ants</a> in Germany. I would certainly get <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/invasion-of-the-2mm-long-ants/">locked up</a>. After a prolonged campaign of baiting traps with poison, the numbers of my ants declined a bit, but recently they seem to have staged a bit of a comeback, and once again, I'm finding that my sandwiches are ant-garnished.</p>
