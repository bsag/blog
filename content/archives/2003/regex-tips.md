<p>I've always found regular expressions slightly baffling. Since I've been learning Perl, I've made more of an effort to understand them, but I often find myself bashing my forehead on the table in frustration when a regex pattern refuses to do my bidding. So I was interested in <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2003/08/21/regexp.html?page=1">this selection of top regex tips</a>, which contains some useful pointers to avoid problems. It seems that the author--TonyÂ Stubblebine (a surname worthy of Thomas Hardy)--has published one of the O'Reilly Pocket References on <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/regexppr/index.html?CMP=IL7015">Regular Expressions</a>, which I might consider getting. I have the Perl Pocket Reference, and find it handy to carry about for a quick consultation on some syntax matter or other. With Perl, BBEdit, Mailsmith and now Vim, I've got plenty of opportunities to practice my regexes for fun and profit. Well, fun anyway...</p>
