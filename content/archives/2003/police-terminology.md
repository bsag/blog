<p>I had to go and report <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/casualty">my accident</a> to the Police yesterday, and found to my surprise that one of the multiple-choice options for describing the cause of the incident was &mdash; and I'm quoting the exact phrase here &mdash; 'looking without seeing'. The very phrase I had used! Trying to describe my bike was a bit of a problem: "So, does it have a registration plate?". The driver seemed to have formed the impression that it was a motorized vehicle &mdash; if only! I suppose it does have a motor, but it's a very inefficient and under-powered one.</p>
