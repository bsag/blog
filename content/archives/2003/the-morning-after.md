<p>So how did you celebrate the New Year? We decided not to venture out into the cold and wet (Oxford is also curiously dead at New Year), and instead planned an evening in. We got a great Chinese take-away from <a href="http://www.oriental-condor.co.uk/" title="Great Chinese food">The Oriental Condor</a> (not Asian-Andean fusion food, as you might conclude from the name). We had a bottle of red and a bottle of sparkling wine, and watched <a href="http://www.thedudeshouse.com/firstpage.php" title="The Dude's House">"The Big Lebowski"</a> for the nth time. I swear that that film gets funnier every time I see it. The dialogue alone would make it a classic, but the music and set pieces are just superb. The Busby Berkeley/Wagner dream sequence always makes me gasp for air because I laugh too much. The Dude is truly a hero for our times - The Dude abides, man, The Dude abides.</p>
