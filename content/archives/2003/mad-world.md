<p>I caught the beginning of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/totp2/">Top of the Pops 2</a> this evening, and heard that they were going to be featuring the brilliant version of the Tears For Fears song <a href="http://www.garyjules.com/">Mad World by Gary Jules</a> which closed the equally fantastic film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246578/">Donnie Darko</a>. So I grimly stuck it out through a pile of 80s trash ('The Lambada', anyone?), albeit with a few gems sprinkled in it (Roxy Music), because of course they put Mad World on last.</p>

<p>The song is completely stunning, and the video is pretty special too. I think that it's a bit of a shame that Tears For Fears didn't use a similar arrangement in the original version; the lyrics are so stark and beautiful that they deserve to be heard properly, accompanied only by a quiet piano part. Still, it was the 80s and big synths and over-wrought vocals were where it was at.</p>

<p>Gary Jules' latest album, <a href="http://www.garyjules.com/pages/music.html" title="I love that title!">Trading Snakeoil for Wolftickets</a> sounds like it would be worth a proper listen. It's another one for the Christmas list, I think.</p>
