<p>Here's an interesting experiment; expose a bunch of hip-hop loving 10 and 11 year old American children to Radiohead, and get them to <a href="http://www.eastbayexpress.com/issues/2003-09-17/music.html/1/index.html">draw whatever the music suggests to them</a>. Is this a future law suit waiting to happen? Quite possibly, judging by the slightly disturbing results. Daniel's giant ice cream cone and Maddy's Aladdin scenes are innocuous enough (though ice cream isn't the first thing to pop into my head when I listen to Radiohead), but Jeffrey and Adam could be scarred for life.</p>
