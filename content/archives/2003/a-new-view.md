<p>[28th March 2003]</p>

<p>We loved sailing so much, we couldn't resist going again. We had beautiful weather, and when I wasn't in the driving seat (I don't think I have the correct nautical term there), I curled up on my side on the canvas stretched between the main hull and the outrigger hulls. From this position I have a whole new view on the world. In the middle of my field of view, a very thin band of human habitation divides my view in half, stretched tight from top to bottom. It is padded on the left side by a vertical strip of fluffy white clouds, with blue sky stretching away to the extreme left of my vision. On the right of the land, the green sea streams gently downwards. From this perspective, the landscape seems more democratic -- less hierarchical. I wish I had a camera with me.</p>
