<p class="img-shadow"><imgsrc="/mt-static/blog/archives/images/new_bus.jpg" alt="Shiny new bus" width="160" height="120" border="0" />I chickened out of cycling in today because of the frost, so I got the bus. The company that runs our route has finally splashed out on some new buses. When I got on, I commented to the driver that I liked the shiny new vehicle. She grimaced and said "I don't - I'm scared of breaking it!". When we passed another driver on the route, he gave a 'Royal wave' (index finger loosely extended, rotating the wrist) to say, "Ooo, get you with your posh Mercedes-Benz bus - you won't be wanting to talk to us commoners in the canteen."</p>
