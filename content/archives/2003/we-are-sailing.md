<p>[Tuesday 25th March]</p>

<p>I'm going to have to move to somewhere on the coast or near a large body of water, as I've just got hooked on sailing. After a <em>lot</em> of deliberation (Mr. Butshesagirl and I are useless decision-making: "What do you want to do?" "I don't know -- what do you want to do?") we plumped for sailing. We hired a trimaran for 2 hours at Dunedin (not the one in Scotland, obviously).</p>

<p>Now, we have never sailed in our lives, so we had a brief lesson and then we were off into the wide blue yonder. It was fantastic -- just the sound of the water on the hull, the wind in the sail, and me yelling "Watch out for that jet-ski!". We saw an osprey with a fish in its talons, gannets diving and pelicans mooching about. And sailing itself is so satisfying: when you get it just right you wait till the wind picks up the sail, then you pull it in a bit and off you go. We're not going to be doing a round the world yacht race any time soon, but we were going vaguely in the direction we wanted to go in at about the right time, and having a lot of fun, so I think we were more or less doing it right.</p>

<p>So now we just need to save up about $4,000 for the trimaran and move to somewhere warm so that we don't get hypothermia pursuing our new hobby.</p>
