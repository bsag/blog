<p>I've just watched the last of <a href="http://www.channel4.com/granddesigns/buckinghamshire.html">Grand Designs</a>. To be honest, I'm not sure why I've been watching it: we can't afford to buy any kind of of house in Oxford, let alone build some state-of-the-art, luxury design statement, so watching this program is somewhat masochistic. Anyhoo, this week's build didn't go entirely according to plan, to put it rather mildly. But the chaos prompted Tom, the owner, to come out with the most perfect expression I think I've ever heard.</p>

<blockquote>It's a five-star, fur-lined, ocean-going balls up.</blockquote>

<p>Oh, I like that a lot. Actually, I like Tom a lot, and not just because he laughs like Harry Secombe in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbc7/comedy/progpages/goons.shtml">The Goons</a> -- I can think of few people who would maintain their sense of humour in the face of such construction related adversity.</p>
