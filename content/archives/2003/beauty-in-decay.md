<p>For one reason or another, I haven't been taking many photos of my own recently, but I have been gathering a lot of inspiration from others for my next bout of photographic frenzy. The consistently great <a href="http://28mm.org/issue/9/">28MM</a> has some really fantastic images this month, but my favourite by far is <a href="http://28mm.org/about.php?artist=richardearney&amp;issue=9">Beauty in Decay</a> by Richard Earney. Not only are they technically and aesthetically interesting, but I really like the whole concept of seeking out flowers which are dying or dead, and of finding beauty in everything &mdash; no matter how unlikely the subject matter may seem.</p>

<p>One of the things I love about photography is the way that it forces you to really <em>see</em> things, rather than just looking at them.</p>
