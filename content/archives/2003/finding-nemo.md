<p>I finally got around to seeing <a href="http://www.pixar.com/featurefilms/nemo/">Finding Nemo</a> today, and was really stunned by it. The quality of the animation--as always with Pixar films--was breathtaking. Every second, you could see weeks of painstaking animation work and rendering just flashing by in the background. I got the feeling that--as with the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/fastuserswitching/">rotating cube effect</a> for fast user switching--they just did it because they could. It was very funny (with plenty of jokes for both adults and children), and the plot raced along at a tremendous pace. What I didn't really expect was that it would be so educational. I'm convinced that you could probably learn a fair amount of marine biology and dentistry from watching this film. I mean, how many other animations have you seen that include the phrase <a href="http://www2.biology.ualberta.ca/palmer/thh/f/cf12.htm">sub-oesophageal ganglion</a>?</p>
