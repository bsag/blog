<p>I <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/slim-and-speedy/" title="Slim and speedy">wasn't far wrong</a>: the brilliant developers at SliMP3 have updated the server again to <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/su_downloads.html">support AAC encoded files</a>, using the <a href="http://lame.sourceforge.net/" title="LAME project at Sourceforge">LAME MP3 encoder</a> which transcodes to MP3 on the fly &mdash; very clever stuff. I haven't listened to enough AAC encoded tracks yet to judge the difference in quality (and whether it makes any difference transcoding it back to MP3), but with a casual listen, it sounds pretty good. There's also support for cover art, so album covers imported into iTunes now appear automatically in the SliMP3 web interface. More proof &mdash; if proof were needed &mdash; of the power and flexibility of Perl.</p>
