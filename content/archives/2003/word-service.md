<p>I've always been a big fan of Services in MacOSX. I think that they go some way to enabling the kind of complete integration between applications which would be great if it actually worked properly. I found a collection of free standalone services called <a href="http://www.devon-technologies.com/freeware.php">Word Service</a>, developed by Devon Technologies. There are three sets, grouped by function: 'Convert' contains options which do useful tasks like changing the case of the selection, removing quotes, or altering the encoding of line endings; 'Insert' lets you insert the contents of the path, or the current date and/or time in different formats; 'Format' does all kinds of useful things like removing multiple spaces, surplus line endings, and sorting lines alphabetically. There are all things I often find myself needing, so it's very handy to have them available in almost every application.</p>

<p>There seem to have been some improvements to the Services menu in Panther. Jaguar had a really irritating bug which meant that if you had more than a certain number of services, the whole menu would refuse to show up in Carbon applications. That seems to have been resolved now, which is great news.</p>
