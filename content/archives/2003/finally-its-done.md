<p>After what seems like an unbelievably long and <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/frustration/" title="Frustration">painful gestation</a>, Mr. Bsag's gallery site has finally <a href="http://www.artfall.co.uk" title="Artfall">been born</a>. I feel slightly awkward about advertising it here, but I'm hoping that no-one will object too much to what <a href="http://www.hitthosekeys.com" title="Lisa's site">Lisa</a> called "a plug for something in the family".</p>

<p>It isn't perfect by any means. I had to make a lot of compromises in all kinds of areas to get it done in a reasonable amount of time. It's much less fancy than I was hoping, but I can always tinker a bit with it later. I also have no doubt that it will fail in all sorts of horrible ways on other platforms and browsers. If anyone has the energy to send me a bug report, please do. I really couldn't bring myself to check the validation this weekend, so I make no claims about its compliance with standards.</p>

<p>If any of you actually feel like buying anything, please feel free! We (and our bank manager) would be pretty happy about that...</p>
