<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006OA4W/butshesagirl-21" title="Click here to browse this CD on Amazon.co.uk"><img class="pixframesmall" src="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/blog/archives/images/daniel_lanois_shine.jpg" border="1" align="left" alt="cover" /></a>Daniel Lanois is one of those artists who record new albums very rarely, but whose output I await eagerly. Given the quantity and quality of his 'other work', I'm amazed that he gets anything of his own recorded at all: he has <a href="http://www.daniellanois.com/biography.htm" title="Biography">produced albums</a> for U2, Peter Gabriel, Bob Dylan, and collaborated with other eminent musicians like Brian Eno. I have his two previous albums ('Acadie' and 'For The Beauty of Wynona'), and I love them to bits. 'Acadie' is a very intimate album, with a lot of allusions to Acadian/Cajun culture and song. It's almost rough &mdash; but I mean that in a good way! 'For The Beauty of Wynona' is different again, evoking industrial landscapes and the lives of blue-collar workers, and has a darker tone, especially on the title track. So I was curious about where he was going to go with 'Shine'.</p>

<p>I'll put it simply &mdash; it's one of the most beautiful albums I've heard in a long time. The songs are very gentle, warm and intimate. It's a perfect album for late at night or lazy Sunday mornings, but you can appreciate the subtle mix, fantastic guitar playing and warm vocals at any time. Daniel Lanois is a bit like Peter Gabriel in that he doesn't have a great vocal range, but he has a wonderful emotionally expressive voice and uses it superbly.</p>

<p>The feel of the album reminds me a little of the mellower moments of Cream (for you young 'uns, I'm referring to the <a href="http://www.thecream.net/" title="Cream.net">60's supergroup</a>, not the Manchester clubbing empire). The unlikely combination of Bono and Emmylou Harris guest on a couple of tracks (separate ones, you might be glad to know), and do a great job adding to the atmosphere, but my favourite tracks are the later solo efforts. 'Slow Giving' is a wonderful, sensual song, and 'Shine' is pure feel-good music, without ever being soppy or saccharine. Daniel Lanois is something of a hidden gem; do yourself a favour &mdash; dig him up, dust him off a little and lose yourself in the shining facets.</p>
