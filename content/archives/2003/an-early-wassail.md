<p><img class="pixframesmall" src="/mt-static/blog/archives/images/Picture006_10Dec03.jpg" alt="Lovely cider" width="160" height="120" border="0" />It's a bit early for proper Wassailing (toasting the apple trees with cider in January to wish them good health for the season to come), but never mind. I love cider, and there's nothing nicer on a cold dark evening than a crisp, dry strong cider. A note for North Americans: I'm talking about the stuff with alcohol in, not glorified apple juice. Boy, was I disappointed when I discovered that little cultural difference...</p>
