<p>As a kind of bribery/attempt to reinforce a positive association between XHTML-wrangling and pleasure, I treated myself to watching the DVD of Woody Allen's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0792846079/104-0830456-7959129?vi=glance" title="Amazon entry for this DVD">Everything You Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask)</a> on Monday night. I saw it ages ago, but it was fun to watch again. It's not a vintage Allen film by any means (the sketches are a bit variable in quality &mdash; some are hilarious while others are a bit so-so), but one line made me sit up and take notice. Gene Wilder plays a doctor treating an Armenian patient who is in love with a sheep. The doctor meets the <em>ovine fatale</em> in question and falls head over heels for her, sneaking off to a hotel and ordering caviar for himself and lawn clippings for the lady. Anyway, my point is that when the doctor introduces himself, he says his name is "Ross &mdash; Doug Ross". What? Surely the writers of <a href="http://www2.warnerbros.com/ertv/home.html" title="Official ER site">ER</a> didn't chose the name of the charming Dr. Ross at random? I'll never be able to watch old episodes of ER and see Doug Ross in the same way again.</p>
