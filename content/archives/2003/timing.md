<p>[Tuesday 18th March]</p>

<p>With my usual perfect timing, I end up travelling the day before war breaks out. Typical. My Dad's advice -- "Don't mention the war!" (in Basil Fawlty voice). I'll have to try to remember that, or I might find myself in an orange jumpsuit in Guantanamo Bay. It feels rather odd to be away from home with everything that's going on -- I'm missing the BBC coverage a lot, imperfect though it is.</p>

<p>I've never really watched CNN before (not having cable or satellite), but I don't really care for it. The war coverage in particular strikes me as being somewhat voyeuristic and doesn't really ask any difficult questions. Their little statistics graphics for the 'planes, tanks and weapons really remind me of "Top Trumps" -- if anyone remembers that card game. I saw an interview with three American soldiers, where the interviewer asked them if they wanted to say hello to anyone back home. The first two said hi to the usual friends, family and girlfriends, but the last one thanked Oakley, for "making the best sunglasses in the world". Oops. The CNN reporters crawled all over themselves to point out that it <em>wasn't</em> a product placement.</p>
