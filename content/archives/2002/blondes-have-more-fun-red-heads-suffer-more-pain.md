<p>Apparently it's true: red-haired women needed <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99992923">20% more anaesthetic</a> than brunettes. Mr. Butshesagirl is a ginger-nut, so now he knows why he hates going to the dentist.</p>

<p>He was also very proud when it was reported <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/blueprint/2000-01/3105/11.shtml">last year</a> that the gene from red hair is at least 10,000 years old, and may possibly have originated in Neanderthals.</p>
