<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uklatest/story/0,1271,-2149026,00.html">This</a> is totally nuts: the sooner house prices return to some kind of sanity, the better. Otherwise, Mr. Butshesagirl and I face a lifetime of renting, with the full horror of other people's taste in chintzy soft furnishings that this entails.</p>

<p>What really got me was the quote from the local estate agent: "It is a nice little place and at the price you can't really go wrong."</p>

<p>Now, just read that quote again slowly to yourself with a cool flannel applied soothingly to your forehead. Nearly 60 grand a reasonable sum for what is basically a shed? Proof, if proof were needed, that estate agents are from a parallel universe in which "compact" means "efficient" and not " you can't sit down without cracking your knees on the opposite wall".</p>
