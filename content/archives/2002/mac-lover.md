<p>Oh my. It looks like I might have to stop describing myself as a <a title="Wired News: Fetishists Really Love Their Macs" href="http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,56409,00.html">Mac lover</a>. I don't take it quite that far, though. True, I have been known to stroke my TiBook lovingly, but there's nothing going on between us. We're just good friends, aren't we darling?</p>

<p>Take a look at the picture of "iMac Boy" that accompanies the piece, and answer me this question: why does his mouse look so angry?</p>
