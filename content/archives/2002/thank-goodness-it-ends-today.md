<p>Not a moment too soon, <a title="Channel4.com - Big Brother - the official BigBrother uk website" href="http://www.channel4.com/apps3/bigbrother/index.jsp">Celebrity Big Brother</a> ends today. My views on the current obsession with celebrity will be well known to those of you who have visited my "About" page. All I can say is that I have accidentally alighted on CBB once or twice this week while channel hopping, and my brain has nearly imploded with the sheer vacuousness of it. I know some people say that putting down shows like Big Brother is in some way snobbish and elitist. I'm not saying that it shouldn't be shown - if people genuinely want to watch it, that's fine. It's just that I don't even begin to see the point or the attraction. If you want to watch people doing nothing, why not do it on the bus? At least you get to go somewhere at the same time.</p>
