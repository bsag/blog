<p>It's happened at last - I've finally got round to getting my gallery fixed up. It doesn't have a lot of pictures in it yet, but that will gradually change over the next few weeks. Take a look <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/wingsopenwide/index.html" title="My new gallery/photblog">here</a>, or follow the link in the new navigation bar above (so much newness!). I've also added a handy little widget in the sidebar so that you can see a thumbnail of the latest picture here, courtesy of the wonderful MTOtherBlog plugin, developed by <a href="http://www.rayners.org/archives/000108.php" title="MTOtherBlog Plugin">David Raynes</a>.</p>

<p>Enjoy, and let me know what you think.</p>
