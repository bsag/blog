<p>I've set everything up at my new host, <a href="http://www.blogomania.com" title="There's always room for one more!">Blogomania</a>, so all it needs is for the DNS changes to propagate through the system. If you can see this post, it means it's already happened! Everything went incredibly smoothly really. The folks at Blogomania and on the support forums were really helpful, and after a few minor hitches due to my own stupidity, all was well.</p>
