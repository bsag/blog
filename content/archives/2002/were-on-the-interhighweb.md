<p>I was having a coffee at the little AMT kiosk in town and noticed a sign advertising AMT's new website. The tagline was (wait for it) "Don't worry it isn't boring!"</p>

<p>Wow. The advertising budget for that campaign must have stretched to literally tens of pence. Perhaps they made a leap for the <a href="http://www.bbedit.com/">BBEdit</a> "It doesn't suck" pinnacle of coolness, but instead they crashed into the valley of mediocrity. I'm afraid that I was so stunned by the tagline that the URL didn't even register, so I can't provide a link. Oddly, a cursory Google didn't turn it up either.</p>

<p>They do make a damn fine cup of coffee, though.</p>
