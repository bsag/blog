<p>Once again, the heavens opened this morning while I was cycling to work. I know I go on about the weather a fair bit, but;</p>

<ol>
<li>I'm British, and therefore obliged to squeeze weather-related conversation in at every possible opportunity.</li>
<li>I cycle almost every day, and therefore have much more contact with the weather than those who commute by bus or car. Literally.</li>
</ol>

<p>This morning I discovered an unfortunate side effect of the recumbent position: when you're wearing a waterproof jacket and over-trousers, the angle between your upper and lower body provides an excellent container for rain. By the end of my journey this morning, I had a small ornamental water feature in my lap. A certain amount of slopping occurs around corners and as you accelerate and brake, so some of the water inevitably finds its way under your waterproofs. I can see that there might be a minuscule but grateful market for recumbent-specific clothing, which drains the "lap pond" away safely.</p>
