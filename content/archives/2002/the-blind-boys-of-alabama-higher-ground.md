<p>This was a post-Christmas purchase, and a very good one, too. I have another of their albums, Spirit of the Century, and this is every bit as good. It's a lovely mix of blues, gospel and spirituals, sung by some guys who have been singing together for 60 years, and assisted by Robert Randolph and Ben Harper. You can hear their experience in every song. Their voices are like beautiful, old wooden chairs - polished to a fine, warm patina by their lives.</p>

<p>There are some new tunes (People Get Ready, Stand By Me) some traditional ones (Wade in the Water, Freedom Road), and the funkiest version of the 23rd Psalm you'll ever hear (You and Your Folks/23rd Psalm). You might not think you like gospel, but trust me - you'd love this. It's perfect feel-good music.</p>
