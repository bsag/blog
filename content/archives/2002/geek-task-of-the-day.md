<p>My geeky task for the day was to install a <a title="Adding a news ticker to SLiMP3" href="http://newswall.org.uk/~slimp3/news_ticker.html">BBC News ticker</a> on my <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/" title="A very cool ethernet MP3 player">SliMP3 player</a>. Mission accomplished! It works really well, and beats the hell out of using Ceefax or Teletext to check news headlines or the weather.</p>

<p>It also shows the power and flexibility of the SliMP3 server, which is open source and written in Perl. You can think of all sorts of other useful information which could be sucked off the web and displayed on the unit: TV schedules, more detailed weather forecasts, stock prices and so on. Kudos to both Gordon Johnston and the guys at Slim Devices Inc.</p>
