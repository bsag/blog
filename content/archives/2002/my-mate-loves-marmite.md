<p>If you love (or hate) Marmite, you might be interested in this <a title="Lots of talk about Marmite" href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/21958">load of waffle on the subject</a>. Mr. Butshesagirl was very amused as he is a Class A Marmite addict. He even took took a jar when we went to Florida earlier this year, and got rather agitated when he thought he might have to give it up at customs. As it was, they did let us in the country with it, and he made it his mission to convert a significant proportion of the American populace to the joys of the sticky brown stuff. When we left, we donated the jar to the motel restaurant where it probably resides to this very day - a solace to homesick Brits. When we travel, we like to abide by the old adage, "Leave nothing behind but your Marmite".</p>
