<p>So I'm not the <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/mmm-blue-leds">only one</a> who <a href="http://www.business2.com/articles/mag/print/0,1643,44549,FF.html">speculates</a> about the appeal of blue leds (via <a href="http://boingboing.net/#85649964">Boing Boing</a>).</p>

<p>I had no idea that it partially originated with what would be maximally visible to the ageing eyes of middle-aged men, though! Not being rich enough to afford hi-fi classy enough to sport the blue 'uns, I've got a Rega Planet with a rather nice, retro 70's calculator red display.</p>
