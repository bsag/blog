<p>The Microsoft Media Presence lab is developing something called <a title="MyLifeBits" href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993084">MyLifeBits</a>, a multimedia database to store everything that ever happens to you. The idea is that you can then easily find what you're looking for.</p>

<blockquote>"The motivation? Microsoft argues that our memories often deceive us: experiences get exaggerated, we muddle the timing of events and simply forget stuff. Much better, says the firm, to junk such unreliable interpretations and instead build a faithful memory on that most reliable of entities, the PC."</blockquote>

<p>Eeek. PCs, reliable? I can just imagine the lawsuits when someone's whole life goes up in digital smoke. It would give a whole new meaning to Blue Screen of Death. Not the mention the total spookiness of Microsoft having even more control over your life.</p>

<p>On the one hand, I need something like this - badly. On the other, I think that memory is unreliable for a reason. If you couldn't suppress the bad things and promote the good things in your memory, life would be rather grim. How else can you explain women having a second child?</p>
