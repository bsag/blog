<p>I've been having a bit of a tinker with the site. I wanted to convert the site valid XHTML, with the page layout handled by CSS. After a lot of effort, I think I've done it. It looks more or less the same, but it should be standards compliant and, more importantly easier to maintain. Bear with me if there are a few glitches for a little while.</p>
