<p>I want to go to bed, but I think I've finally got full comment functionality back, and I've restored the previous comments. I had to add them manually myself, so I'm afraid that the posting dates are all wrong. Anyway, at least your words of wisdom are preserved...</p>

<p>There are two morals of this story:</p>

<ol>
<li>BACK THE FRELLING THING UP, YOU IDIOT!</li>
<li>Maybe think about switching hosts. I think part of this problem might be host-related, and anyway, I'll be running out of space before too long.</li>
</ol>
