<p><a href="http://www.foundmagazine.com/">This site</a> exhibits a plethora of strange found objects (photographs, notes and so on), which give tantalizing or bizzare glimpses into other people's lives. The photographs are particularly poignant. Strangely addictive.</p>

<p>Some of the photographs reminded me of those we found at my great aunt's after she died. She was a spinster (what a truly awful word) in her nineties when she died, and to us children was a slightly fierce old lady. But the photographs revealed another side to her entirely - young, happy and having a laugh with her friends. One wonderful sepia print (probably from about the 1920s or 30s) showed my great aunt in a group of male and female friends, drinking cider in a cornfield, laughing and smiling. It was like a scene from "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/tg/stores/detail/-/books/0141182776/reviews/202-2458359-5599816">Cider with Rosie</a>", and almost impossible to reconcile with the old lady we knew.</p>
