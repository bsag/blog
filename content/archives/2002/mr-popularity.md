<p>So <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2336091.stm">Saddam</a> got 100% backing for another seven years, eh? With 100% turnout  of 11.5  million voters? Yeah, right. A BBC correspondent on Today said that when asked whether they thought that the result was slightly laughable, they said that it must be right because nobody would vote against him. Impeccable logic.</p>

<p>Love <a href="http://www.fishrush.com/blog/archives/additional_legislation.htm">this</a> though...</p>
