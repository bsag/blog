<p>There seem to be some teething problems with comments. You may encounter a "500 Internal Server Error" if you click a comments link. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Who knows why. If you try again later, it will probably work. It's a very general error (basically it means that something went wrong when a perl script was run), and is thus rather tricky to pin down.</p>
