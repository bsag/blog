<p>Mr. Butshesagirl and I are off to my folk's place for Christmas tomorrow, first doing mightly battle with the jams on the M25. Since we'll be deep in ancient dial-up territory (and no doubt, busy stuffing our faces with mince pies) I'll be off the air for a few days.</p>

<p>Have a good holiday yourselves, and remember - it's rude to eat all the green triangles from the box of Quality Street.</p>
