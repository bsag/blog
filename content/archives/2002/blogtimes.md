<p>You might have noticed a new barcode-like image at the top of this page. It's a linear plot of the posting times for all my entries in the current month, courtesy of a cool little plugin written by <a href="http://nilesh.org/mt/blogtimes/" title="Cool BlogTimes Plugin">Nilesh Chaudhari</a>. What's the point of it? Well, there isn't one. It looks cool and reminds me of a time when I used to work on pigeon navigation, and had to deal with orientation data using <a href="http://www.wspc.com/books/mathematics/4031.html" title="A book on circular statistics">circular statistics</a> (time is circular too). As you can see, I'm an afternoon/evening blogger (primarily because, when I'm not on holiday, I have to post entries after work). There will be a new (and mostly blank) plot tomorrow as it's a new month and a New Year. Have a great one, folks!</p>
