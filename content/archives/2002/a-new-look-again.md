<p>I've been tinkering again. I decided to switch the publishing of this site over to <a href="http://www.moveabletype.org">Moveabletype</a>, and in the process, I redesigned the appearance a little bit again. It should have substantially the same feel, but hopefully it won't suffer from the same bugs in IE6. That's my hope, anyway.</p>

<p>The move to Moveabletype (MT) shouldn't be seen as any kind of negative commentary on Tinderbox. I'm still writing and organizing the site on Tinderbox, then dragging and dropping the notes into MT. Both have their strengths and weaknesses, but by this method I get the best of both worlds. I can write and organize the site on my own machine, but can also publish from an internet cafe when on the move. MT also gives me an easy way for people to post comments (see the comment links under each post), and other ways to archive posts. None of which I couldn't do with TB with a little effort, but I'm lazy.</p>

<p>The old archive file is still available, so if you've linked to any of my posts, that link won't break. I've also imported the old posts so that they're available here too. You can still use the old URL, which will be redirected here.</p>

<p>Let me know what you think of the new look, and tell me whether I've broken anything.</p>
