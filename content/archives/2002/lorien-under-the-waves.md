<p>This album was another of my brother's recommendations (always a man of taste when it comes to music). They are a rather exotic set of people: an Italian vocalist/guitarist, an Icelandic guitarist and a drummer from, er, Weston-super-Mare.</p>

<p>They have a nicely melancholic, gentle, airy style, which would go very nicely with a glass of red wine in front of a log fire in the depths of winter (if I had a log fire). The lead singer, Fabio, has a lovely voice, and endearingly odd pronunciation. The mix of instrumentation they use catches and holds your attention (particularly on "Octopus"), and evokes a slightly otherworldly atmosphere which goes well with their name. One word of advice: if you listen to the lyrics, don't try to understand them. It will only lead to frustration.</p>
