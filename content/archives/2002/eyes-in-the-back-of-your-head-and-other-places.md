<p>I was convinced that <a href="http://wearcam.org/domewear/" title="Mad wearable security cameras">this</a> [via <a href="http://www.boingboing.net" title="BoingBoing">BoingBoing</a>] was a wind up. Can you see yourself wearing the <a href="http://wearcam.org/domewear/heartcam.htm" title="HeartCam">Heartcam</a>? Sure, it might prevent you being the victim of crime, but that would be because potential attackers are paralysed with laughter. Still, it might be amusing for those "Hello, I'm up here" moments (women - you know what I'm talking about).</p>
