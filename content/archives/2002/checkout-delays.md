<p>Winter is dribbling in. Today is one of those days when Britain exhibits its ability to produce really world class drizzle. By this I mean rain that isn't sufficiently forceful to be exciting, but just enough to make you thoroughly wet and miserable. Mr. Butshesagirl and I had to go into town this morning, and Cornmarket Street was a sea of umbrellas, grey puddles and grim faces.</p>

<p>While we were in the tiny branch of Sainsbury's searching vainly for veggie sausages, there was an announcement on the public address system: "We apologise for the delays customers are currently experiencing at the tills". There was a pause, and for one glorious moment, I thought that she might be about to blame '<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/503221.stm">leaves on the line</a>' for the wait. But no, it turned out to be "a technical fault" - probably the barcode scanner had got bored with going beep (see Eddie Izzard sketch about the short attention span of supermarket barcode scanners).</p>
