<p>I've just updated the XML button using one of the lovely set that <a href="http://www.antipixel.com/blog/index.shtml">Jeremy Hedley</a> has posted. Swish, eh? If some of you are wondering what the heck that little orange button does, just click it (natch) and copy the URL of the resulting page into the "Suscribe" dialog of an RSS newsreader (like the excellent <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire Lite</a>), and bingo bongo, you have but she's a girl headlines updated automatically for your surfing pleasure. Go on, you know it makes sense!</p>
