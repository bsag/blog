<p>I didn't get a chance to post about this earlier, but Monday's "<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/partridge/" title="King of Anglia">I'm Alan Partridge</a>" was sheer genius. His blow-by-blow re-enactment (literally!) of "The Spy Who Loved Me", when Tex taped over it with "America's Strongest Man", had me gasping for air. I thought he did the title sequence with the naked women writhing around on a big gun particularly well. It gets better and better.</p>
