<p>According to a report in <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa003&amp;articleID=000EB124-AE08-1DBD-94E2809EC5880108">Scientific American</a>, researchers have found that Tetris is actually a very hard problem to solve. One of the authors of the original report, Erik D. Demaine, said:</p>

<p>"While you're playing Tetris, you're really solving hard problems"</p>

<p>This totally validates all that time I spent bashing away at a monochrome version of Tetris on my old PowerBook 100 when I should have been writing my thesis. Hey, I was training my mind! And having lots of dreams about oddly shaped blocks falling all around me...</p>
