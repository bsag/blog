<p>This afternoon was The Great Work Christmas Do. There was a slightly different format this year - gone were the tiny sandwiches, sausage rolls and cheese and pineapple on a stick. This year we had a proper sit down Christmas dinner with all the trimmings, and (more importantly) lots of free booze. Me and my co-workers are a cynical old bunch, so our expectations of a 3 quid dinner weren't what you might call high, but it was really quite impressive.</p>

<p>Then there was the disco. At 3pm. This was just plain wrong on so many levels. Even the provision of copious quantities of more free booze and ABBA on the sound system couldn't pack the dancefloor out. As far as I know, no one tried to photocopy unusual parts of their anatomy, have any ill-advised sexual liasons, or go on an expedition through the ventilation ducts. But it was still a good party.</p>
