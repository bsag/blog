<p>I have no idea whether this <a href="http://www.thewavemedia.com/pagegen.php?pagename=article&amp;articleid=22646" title="Weird Turkish Star Trek">video</a> [via BoingBoing] is real or not, but if it isn't it should be. I really, really want to see it. The "beaming down" effects sound like they would be worth the price on their own. Let's face it, anything would be better than the blandness that is <a href="http://www.startrek.com/launch/default.asp" title="Official Enterprise Site">Enterprise</a>.</p>

<p>One question: why is Fidel Castro chatting to Spock in the poster for the video at the top of the page?</p>
