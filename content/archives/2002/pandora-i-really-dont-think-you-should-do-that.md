<p>In the little coffee room on my floor at work, a fridge-freezer has just appeared. It's a standard domestic model, only distinguished by the sign on the door.</p>

<p>"Experiment in progress. Do not open."</p>

<p>I am aflame with curiosity. What's the experiment? Why is it taking place in a fridge? What dreadful calamity would befall me if I took a peek? Is it all a Cunning Plan to stop people  stealing this guy's milk? I guess this is why scientists can get into so much trouble. One minute you're thinking, "I wonder what would happen if I dropped a lit match on this large heap of grey powder?", and the next moment all that's left is a pair of smoking boots.</p>
