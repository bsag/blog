<p>Ah, there's nothing like a bit of Jimi as the nights are drawing in. Remasterings don't always work well, but this one has kept the spontaneity of the original, and everything (particularly the live material) sounds fresh and funky. If there's any music that could tempt me to get my air guitar out of the cupboard, Crosstown Traffic or Foxey Lady is it. I still find it hard to believe that there's only one person playing lead guitar.</p>
