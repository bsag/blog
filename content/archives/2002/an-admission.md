<p>I made a big decision today. I came out as an <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/" title="Archer's site for very sad people">Archers</a> listener. Note that I said "listener", not "fan". This is very important. I don't, for instance, feel the need to write to the BBC and complain that cows take about 300 days to be cured of mastitis, and NOT two weeks as the so-called writers believe<sup>1</sup>. Nor do I believe that Ambridge is a real place. I know this because:</p>

<ol>
<li> Everyone knows each other, and, more importantly, speaks to one another.</li>
<li> Ambridge has a village shop, and people buy things in it every day.</li>
<li> No one goes to a big supermarket.</li>
<li> Everyone who lives in the village works in it. It is not full of people who visit at the weekends and find it "terribly convenient for the City - just a quick hop down the motorway in the Beemer on a Friday night".</li>
</ol>

<p>Despite all that, it's blummin' exciting at the moment. Mr. Smarmy-Love-Rat-Git-Face-Bastard (aka Brian Aldridge) has finally been found out, and now has to choose between sultry Irish temptress Siobhan, and long-suffering wife and cake-baker extraordinaire, Jennifer. It'll all end in tears, you mark my words.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>When surfing briefly to check the correct recovery rate (I know - I'm a sad sad person, but I aim for accuracy), I discovered that there is a journal called <i>Udder Topics</i>. I must subscribe immediately.</p>
