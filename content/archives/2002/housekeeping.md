<p>I've been doing a bit of housekeeping on this site today. I've added a few links to the Browsing section in the sidebar to update it with some weblogs I've started reading recently. I've also fixed the "More.." link in the About box so that it actually goes to the about page as promised. Sorry about that - the link broke when I moved hosts, and I've only just noticed.</p>

<p>I've also been doing some more work on my long-promised photoblog/gallery. It's still not done (I'm being a bit of a perfectionist with it), but it should be coming soon. I'm hoping that when I finish work for Christmas I'll get a bit more time to sort it out. Watch this space...</p>
