<p>I was glancing at the headlines on a rack of women's magazines while drinking a coffee in a rather dull service station. These caught my eye:</p>

<p>Cosmopolitan: Celebrity Real-Life Stories (an oxymoron if I ever saw one)</p>

<p>Company: 126 Celebrity Hair Secrets (such a precise number - couldn't they dredge up enough celebrity hair secrets to make it up to a round 130?)</p>
