<p>Something has gone a bit pear-shaped with the comments. The comment count has updated correctly, but the comments themselves don't appear on the page. I've posted a question on the Moveabletype support forum, and hopefully some kind soul will help me fix it. If all else fails, I'll reconstruct the comments from the notification emails I received for them.</p>

<p>Normal service will hopefully be resumed in the near future.</p>
