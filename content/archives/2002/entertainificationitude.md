<p>This is more fun than anyone should be allowed to have on a Thursday night. Rearrange <a href="http://www.lemonbovril.co.uk/bushspeech/">Bush's speeches</a> into something with more clarificationitude. My theory is that this is an actual White House speech writing tool. Thanks to <a href="http://boingboing.net/#85595177">Boing Boing</a> for the link.</p>
