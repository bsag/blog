"Without much conscious thought, most of us have built identities across the web. We've filled in profiles, uploaded photos, videos, reviews and bookmarks. The Ident Engine uses semantic web APIâ€™s to bring together these web footprints." Interesting idea: allows you to publish a 'lifestream' from your activity on various social websites on your blog, but currently requires a fairly good knowledge of javascript/jquery to do so.
