Stuart is trying to learn Brazilian Portuguese and finding it hard. Very hard. I can totally sympathise, as my efforts have been even more lame. Whenever I try to pronounce a word, I cringe inwardly, imagining how mangled it sounds to the person listening. If you can't even really hear what a sound is supposed to be, it's very hard to reproduce it.
