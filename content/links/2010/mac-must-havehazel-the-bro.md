I bought Hazel and while ago, and have been meaning to blog about it. This is a very eloquent explanation of the beauty and usefulness of Hazel. I have a Hazel rule (using Applescript) which imports PDF files placed in a 'Receipts to File' folder on my desktop into a Receipts group in DevonThink Pro, then trashes the original. I use that a lot.
