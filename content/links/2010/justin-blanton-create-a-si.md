This is brilliant. I often feel the need for a quick timer like this, but a standalone application feels like overkill. Not only does using a timer mean that you don't miss something because you get wrapped up in work, but it also means that you are free to get wrapped up in work without looking at your watch every two minutes, worrying that you'll forget to do something.
